    JUDGMENT
  MIAN SHAKIRULLAH JAN, J.--- The respondent, a member of the District Judiciary was awarded three adverse ACRs. for the period (i) 1-1-1998 to 31-12-1998 (ii) 1-1-1999 to 30-6-1999 and (iii) 1-1-2000 to 5-7-2000 by the Reporting Officer who in the case of' first two ACRs was District and Sessions Judge, Jhang while in the case of third ACR, he was Sessions Judge/Judge Accountability Court, Bahawalpur. The said ACRs bearing out endorsement by the countersigning officer, not totally agreeing with the Reporting Officer. The incumbent felt aggrieved of the aforesaid adverse ACRs approached the Punjab Subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal, Lahore for the expunction of the same through three different Service Appeals bearing Nos.83 to 85 of 2001. All the three appeals were allowed, through, a common judgment, by the Tribunal after finding that he did not deserve at all the adverse remarks. The appellant, Registrar, Lahore High Court, Lahore has filed three separate Civil Petitions Nos.1483-L to 1485-L of 2003. All the three petitions were fixed before this Court for hearing on 8-12-2003 and out of three, one relating to the ACR for the period pertaining to the year 1-1-1998 to 31-12-1998 was dismissed while in two petitions i.e. 1484-L and 1485-L of 2003, leave to appeal was granted on the ground that the judgment of the Tribunal prima facie appears to be based on certain assumptions which are not sustainable in law"" and which are now before us for adjudication.
  2. Learned A.A.-G. has contended that the remarks of the Reporting Officer are not to be likely interfered with by the Tribunal as it is subjective evaluation on the overall performance, closely watched by the Reporting Officer and when the countersigning authority has not specifically disagreed with him.
  3. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent, in addition to his other contentions, has raised preliminary objection, as noted in the leave granting order, the' question of limitation by stating that the petitions, prior to leave granting order, were hopelessly time-barred. On merits, he has submitted that as evident from the impugned judgment passed on the basis of record of the case that the Reporting Officer was biased having a grievance against the incumbent, who (the respondent), after allotment of official accommodation pressing for its vacation, which was in occupation of the Reporting Officer already transferred from the said station, annoyed him and resulted in the impugned ACRs. The one (ACR) written by another Reporting Officer was on account of communication of the adverse remarks to the respondent, which came to his (Reporting Officer) notice, prior to the writing of the ACR for the period i.e. 1-1-2000 to 5-7-2000, the said Reporting Officer had given the incumbent good remarks, prior to the period i.e. 1-1-2000, i.e. for the remaining six months of the year 1999.
  4. The submission of the learned counsel for the respondent on the question of limitation was that since the copy of the judgment had been sent by the Punjab Subordinate Judiciary Tribunal to the appellant on 4-3-2003 and which was received by him on the same day and by counting the period from that date, the filing of petition/appeal became time-barred which position qua the receipt of the copy on 4-3-2003 was not denied by the appellant and it was contended that for filing of the petition/appeal before this Court other documents, apart from the judgment e.g. the grounds of appeals are required to be filed and it was the only impugned judgment which was sent to the appellant not ' accompanied by other necessary documents and obtaining certified copies of those documents delayed the matter and after getting certified copies of the documents along with the impugned judgment, the petition was filed within time. We inspected the file of this Court and found that the judgment annexed with the grounds/memorandum of petition/appeals bearing the dates as described by the appellant and counting as such the appeal not seems to be time-barred and particularly when three petitions/appeals have been filed against a common judgment and which also requires three separate certified copies of the judgment and the three certified copies of the judgment appears to have not been sent with the covering letter to the appellant. Hence this objection of the learned counsel for the respondent is overruled.
  5. One of the petitions pertaining to the period i.e. 1-1-1998 to 31-12-1998 filed by the present appellant was dismissed by this Court on the date when leave to appeal was granted in the instant petition as no substance was found in that petition.
  6. Though the remarks about the performance of an incumbent may be a subjective evaluation on the basis of objective criteria where substitution for an opinion of the competent authority is generally avoided unless the same is tainted with mala fide, partiality and bias but which factors are found in the instant case for the reasons, referred to above, as annoyance of the Reporting Officer over the insistence of incumbent for the vacation of the official accommodation allotted to him (incumbent) did exist. The case Zahoor Hussain v. Principal of Government College, Sahiwal and others 2005 SCMR 1035 may be referred to. The reasons advanced for the adverse ACRs given by the other Reporting Officer seems to have weight as prior to the ACR in question for a period of the half of the year, good ACR had been given by the same Reporting Officer. It was stated at the bar that the respondent having a long tenure of service about 23 years, had not been given any adverse remarks except the one in question. We do not find the judgment of the Tribunal to be lacking in any aspect as sufficient reasons have been given for the interference by expunging the ACRs and we see no justification to differ with the impugned judgment. Resultantly these appeals have no merit and the same are dismissed. No order as to costs.

  JUDGMENT
  ROSHAN ALI MANGI (MEMBER)‑‑‑The appellant was appointed as an Assistant in the Ministry of Education with effect from 20th July, 1973. He was posted abroad as Assistant vide order dated I‑7‑1992. The appellant in compliance with the office order proceeded along with his family members to Tehran on 21‑7‑1992. As per terms and conditions of his posting order, he was to be provided free furnished Government accommodation at Tehran. On his arrival at Tehran, he stayed in the Hotel initially for six days to avail of the joining time i.e. with effect from 21st to 26th July, 1992.
  2. Due to the deplorable condition of the house, his predecessor was residing in, he did not occupy the house. As a result he had to stay in a Hotel with effect from 21st July to 7th August, 1992, till he got the suitable accommodation. As a consequence, the appellant felt that he was entitled to the grant of Daily Allowance for the period that he over stayed in the hotel i.e. for 12 days till he got the official free furnished accommodation, under rules on the subject at Serial No.47 of (Guidance of Missions Abroad) Vol‑11, 86. He, therefore, submitted his claim duly supported by the necessary documents for the grant of 18 days daily allowance (including six days of joining period) for staying in the Hotel under the circumstances. According to the appellant, his claim amounting to US $ 17,604 was approved by Dy. H.M/CDA on 9‑9‑1992. However, it was not paid to the appellant on one or the other pretext. During the. process of the case, however, according to him, he was compelled to claim for Hotel room rent for reimbursement for 12 days vide letter dated 9‑12‑1992. According to the appellant, during his stay in the Hotel he did not claim the Foreign Allowance. On reaching the home station in Pakistan, the appellant made an application, dated 27th November, 1995, to the Secretary Education for the payment of 12 days Daily Allowance for the period he stayed in the hotel beyond his joining period of six days. However, his appeal/representation was turned down on 26‑12‑1995,, without assigning any reasons.
  3. Hence this appeal.
  4. Pleading the case of the appellant, the learned counsel submitted that under the foreign posting Rules, when a Government servant is unable to find suitable residential accommodation immediately on his arrival at a new post, he would be entitled to draw a daily allowance in lieu of foreign allowance and house rent allowance for himself, and his family. As such the appellant was entitled to the daily allowance for the period he stayed in Hotel beyond the joining period to normal daily allowance as he was not provided suitable accommodation at his arrival. He further submitted that when the. appellant visited the house, vacated by his predecessor, the landlady present , at that time, did not allow him to occupy the said accommodation. Besides this the said house was in a very deteriorated, dilapidated and unhygienic condition not suitable to occupy. The appellant apprised the authorities of the position of the house, therefore, he was advised to occupy the Hotel till some suitable house was found for him. As such under the rules, he was entitled to the daily allowance for the period he overstayed in the Hotel.
  5. The respondent‑department has also filed their preliminary objections whereby the appeal has been vehemently resisted. It has been contended that prior to the posting of the appellant, Mr. Muhammad Azam his predecessor was working there as Assistant and was residing in the said house along with his family members and there had been no complaints whatsoever from him about the house. It was not understood as to how the said house suddenly became completely inhabitable and unhygienic on the arrival of the appellant. It has been pointed out that the house was leased by the Embassy and rent was also not outstanding against the Mission. It was not understood how the landlady refused the appellant to enter the house. Since it was a leased house, therefore, ascertaining the possibility of shifting in it of the appellant was neither necessary nor required. Leasing of the houses of the government is just to facilitate the incoming official with regard to their residential accommodation on one hand and to save the public money on the other. The rent of the leased houses is always paid in advance. The statement of the appellant that in compliance with the orders of the Mission he approached ‑ the landlady but was refused is not understood.
  6. We have heard both the parties at length and also perused the documents.
  7. We find the main issue before us to examine is whether or not the appellant was entitled to the daily allowance under the rules for the period he spent in Hotel beyond the joining period on the plea that the house vacated by his predecessor was not suitable and, therefore, till the suitable accommodation was provided to him, he was to stay in the Hotel.
  8. We were taken to the Embassy's letter, dated 4th March, 1996, in which the Embassy had apprised the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the matter that by the time Mr. Anwar joined this Embassy, the situation with regard to availability of accommodation in Tehran had improved significantly. As an economy measure and to curb the general tendency on the part of the officials concerned to stay in Hotels deliberately in order to get additional D.A., the Embassy, in public interest had decided, as a matter of Policy, not to pay D.A. beyond six days joining time to any official, under any circumstances, and instead pay; only the room rent of the Hotel as admissible under the rules. Incidentally, the appellant was among the first few officials who came under the purview of the above general decision.
  9. We find that this action of the Embassy was in consonance with a d.o. letter written by Mr. Abdul Wahab Khan D.G. (F.A.) to all Embassies on 5‑11‑1981, in which it was clarified that the provision of accommodation is the responsibility of the Mission and the direct responsibility of the heads of Mission whose decision in each case is final. Should an official refuse to accept the accommodation arranged by the head of Mission, the requirement of providing official accommodation having been met, the official himself including disciplinary action for defying official orders must face the consequences. This policy decision was made in view of the misuse of the daily allowance facility when the suitable accommodation could not be made instantaneously as has been explained in the said d.o. letter. It is an admitted fact that the official was provided accommodation but he did not occupy it on the ground that it was in deplorable condition, although his predecessor did not point out any defect prior to the appellant. As a consequence he was allowed to live in the hotel on refusal of the accepting the accommodation already available at that time. The Mission also paid the Hotel charges. This action on the part of the Mission was in accordance with policy decision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and he was rightly not allowed daily allowance in question.
  10. The perusal of the documents further shows although he made a request to the Mission authority to pay him 12 days additional daily allowance for overstaying in the Hotel due to non‑availability of the suitable accommodation nevertheless his request was not acceded to and he was informed in August, 1992. Had the appellant any grievance against this refusal, he should have approached the Secretary Education within a period of thirty days as required under the law or he should have approached the Tribunal in this regard. However, he, remained silent till his arrival back in Pakistan that he made representation to the Secretary Education which was turned down vide a letter, dated 10th April, 1996. In fact his cause to agitate arose in 1992. Now it has become time‑barred.
  11. For the reasons recorded above, the appeal having no merit and subsequently being time‑barred is dismissed on both the accounts with no I order as to costs. .

  JUDGMENT
  MUHAMMAD RAZA KHAN (MEMBER). ‑‑‑The appellant had been serving as Assistant Director‑General (BPS‑19) in the Department o`' Communication Security under the Cabinet Division. He got his premature retirement with effect from 28‑12‑1995 and vide an impugned order dated 19‑3‑1996 the AGPR (respondent No. l), has ordered recovery of Rs.2,34,705.70 from the pension commutation on account of house rent allowance. He field departmental appeal to the respondent No. l on 18‑4‑1996 which has been rejected vide order dated 18‑6‑1996. Hence this appeal.
  2. The gist of the dispute is that the wife of the appellant was serving in Islamabad College for Girls and a Government residential accommodation was provided to her. The appellant contends that he had not been residing with his wife and that he was maintaining a separate establishment at Rawalpindi in House No.85‑D, Jehangir Road, Nadeemabad on account of allergy problems in Islamabad and to look after his aged mother. Allegedly he had intimated this fact to the respondent No.3 being the employer department and that is why, since he had not been residing in the house allotted to his wife at Islamabad, he was getting the house rent allowance as admissible to Government servant, He further adds that he decided to get his premature retirement with effect from December, 1995, and he also decided to shift from his Rawalpindi residence to the residence of his wife at Islamabad and thus on 21‑8‑1995 he intimated to the respondent No. 1 through his parent department (respondent No.3) that since he had shifted to the Government accommodation allotted to his wife, therefore, the house rent allowance may be discontinued. Payment of the house rent was accordingly discontinued and after three months of retirement of the appellant a huge amount, as stated above, was demanded from him as the recovery on account of house rent allowance. In response to departmental appeal it was disclosed by the respondent No. 1, vide letter dated 18‑6‑1996 that ""if one of the spouses has been granted accommodation on the same station the other one is not entitled to house rent allowance"" and that ""both the husband and wife, unless judicially separated, or treated as residing together while serving at the same station"".
  3. The perusal of the record shows that the Office Memorandum, referred to in the impugned appellate order dated 18‑6‑1996, was issued on the basis of policy of 17‑10‑1981, whereas the situation has changed and vide Office Memorandum dated 25‑8‑1991 it was decided that ""if both the husband and wife are living together in residential acc9mmodation provided by the Government at the same station, no house rent shall be allowed to other of them. If however, the spouse is living separately from husband/wife the house rent allowance shall be admissible to one of them who does not reside in Government accommodation"". This is not only a deviation from the earlier policy (relied upon by the respondent No. 1) but was also a logical decision thereby superseding earlier instructions issued in this behalf.
  4. If the view expressed by the respondent No. l in the appellate order is considered to be appropriate it would mean that only on judicial separation the spouse will be entitled to the house rent allowance if any one of them has not been allotted any accommodation. Such an argument will be absurd because on judicial separation there will be no relationship of husband and wife and both will be entitled to the benefits and privileges independently of each other because they cannot be treated as spouses inter se after the pronouncement of verdict of judicial separation. However, if the said impugned appellate order is considered to be final word then what will be fate of the spouses separated otherwise than by judicial process i.e. by the pronouncement of divorce by any of the modes under the Islamic Shariah. There can be another situation that if the husband is provided the Government accommodation and the wife, who‑was also a civil servant, is expelled by the husband from his house, and she is compelled to reside independently, will she be not entitled to the house rent allowance? Similarly it can also be noted that the process of judicial separation takes considerably long time and in such a situation the wife, while residing in desertion, shall be deprived of the house rent allowance for couple of years till the ""judicial separation"" is finalised.
  5. The policy relating to' the admissibility of house rent allowance, needs reconsideration at higher level. If both the spouses are civil servants, they perform their functions independently of each other and shall be entitled l to the benefits of service as independent civil servants. No extra convenience or latitude is extended to any one of them hence, logically, they should be entitled to all the benefits that are admissible for performing their functions separately and independently. It is, neither just nor reasonable to deprive a civil servant for the only reason that his/her spouse has been allotted Government accommodation. If this principle is applied universally many questions and complications can be faced whereby such type of decision will be considered as illogical. Some of the situations are as under:‑‑
  (a) If one of the spouse is allotted a Government accommodation but he is in a lower scale (entitled to smaller type of accommodation), whether the other spouse will be deprived of the chance of better accommodation or the house rent allowance in lieu thereof only on the ground that one of the partner has already been allotted Government accommodation?
  (b) If one of the partners is civil servant in the Federal Government and the other a civil servant in an institution performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation and having independent but autonomous rules for payment of salary etc. will the allotment of accommodation to any one of them be binding on the department of the other to refuse the payment of house rent allowance?
  (c) In case one of the partners is a civil servant and the other working in statutory body having independent status, whether the autonomous body can be compelled to deprive its employee from the benefits admissible to the rest of similar employees?
  (d) Similarly, whether the spirit of the same principle, as applied by the respondent No. 1 can be extended to a situation to deprive the sons and daughters of a civil servant, who are independently performing their functions as civil servant in some other departments on the basis that their father or any one of them has been provided Government accommodation?
  6. These and similar type of several situations can be visualized wherein the refusal to pay a benefit will not only amount to discrimination but will also be unreasonable and violative of the principles of good governance in a civilized democratic society. It is high time the concerned agency should take up the issue to allow the identical benefits equally to all the civil servants performing function of identical nature irrespective of the fact whether he resides in an accommodation provided to the husband/wife or nearer relative. We believe that each individual civil servant is entitled to such benefits irrespective of such extraneous and irrelevant consideration.
  7. In the instant case, the appellant was so conscious that he informed his employer department about his independent residence by a letter as well as by an affidavit. Then he immediately requested for the stoppage of house rent allowance when he decided to shift to the house allotted to his wife. The employer department fully confirms the version of the appellant and the comments filed on behalf of the respondent No. 3, the employer department, admit the contents of all the paragraphs in the memo of appeal. The respondent No. 1 has taken the most severe action of recovery without even consulting the head of the department of the appellant. The respondent No. 1 has practically imposed a penalty without affording chance of hearing. The Supreme Court has held that the principle of natural justice should be read as part and parcel of every statute. No order adverse to a civil servant or to and citizen can be passed by any authority without providing him a chance, of showing cause or of a personal hearing against the action proposed to be taken against him. Therefore, the entire action of the respondent No. 1 was not only violative of the rules promulgated by its controlling division i.e. respondent No. 2 in 1991 but the impugned original order and the appellate order are illogical, unjust and violative of the principle of natural justice.
  8. Hence, we accept this appeal, set aside the impugned orders and remand this case to the respondent No. 1 for a fresh decision in the light of above observations and after affording the opportunity of show cause and personal hearing to the appellant.
  9. No order as to costs.
    H.B.T./160/Sr.F Appeal accepted.

  JUDGMENT
  This is defendant No. 4s Revision Petition which has been directed against judgment dated 17-11-1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Lahore by which on acceptance of appeal and reversal of judgment and decree of the trial Court dated 30-5-1996, through which the suit of respondents Nos.l and 2 for declaration that allotment of Government Quarter No.I-83, Wahdat Colony, Lahore in dispute in his favour (i.e. the present petitioner) was dismissed, has been decreed.
  2. The quarter in dispute i.e. I-83 which was earlier occupied as Government Servant by respondent No.2 who is father-in-law of respondent No. 1 was allotted to the present petitioner by the Provincial Government on 20 5-1992 and possession delivered to him in pursuance thereof after vacation of the same by respondent No.2 on his retirement.
  3. Respondent No. 1 made application seeking allotment of the said quarter on the ground that he was putting up with his father-in-law respondent No.2 in the said quarter and after his retirement the same should be allotted to him. The present petitioner had also made an application for the allotment of a Government Quarter and the quarter in dispute was allotted to him against which respondents 1 and 2 filed Civil suit for declaration from which this revision petition has arisen.
  4. The suit was contested by the present petitioner on a number of legal as well as factual grounds. The controversies arising from the pleadings of the parties were reflected in the following issues framed by the learned trial Court:--
  (1) Whether the suit is barred due to preliminary objections No. 1 and 3 of written statement of defendant No.4 OPD. 4.
  (2) Whether plaintiff has got no locus standi to bring this suit? OPD. 4.
  (3) Whether the suit is barred under sections 56-B and 52-D of the Specific Relief Act? OPD, 1. 2.
  (4) Whether the suit is not maintainable in its present form? OPD.
  (5) Whether the plaintiff No. 1 was not entitled to the quarter in question being an employee of Grade-5? OPD. 1, 2.
  (6) Whether the allotment order made by the defendants 1, 2 in favour of defendant No.4 is illegal, void, based upon mala fide, discriminatory and is liable to be cancelled? OPP.
  (7) If Issue No. 6 is proved then whether the plaintiff is entitled for the allotment of said quarter as consequential relief? OPD
  (8) Relief.
  5. After considering the evidence produced by the parties on these issues the trial Court under Issue No. 1 held that the suit was barred as the previously two suits one of which was for permanent injunction in respect of the same matter and the other for declaration were dismissed in default and withdrawn respectively without permission to file fresh suit therefore, the present suit was not maintainable. On the basis of findings on these issues the suit was dismissed through judgment dated 30-5-1996.
  6. Under Issue No.2 the trial Court held that the plaintiffs had locus standi to file the suit if they could succeed that the order of allotment made in favour of the present petitioner qua the quarter in dispute was not in accordance with law or suffered from mala fides. Under Issue No.3 it was held that the Government functionaries were required to act justly, fairly and treat both the applicants equally as such order of allotment made in favour of the present petitioner suffered from discrimination and was against law as both the applicants being civil servants in grade-5, one should not have been given preference over the other and application of respondent No. 1 being earlier in time therefore the present petitioner could not be given preference over respondent No. 1. Under Issue No.4 it was observed that the same was not pressed therefore it was decided in the negative. Issue No.5 and 6 were decided together and it was held that the order of allotment of the quarter in dispute in favour of the present petitioner was arbitrary and against the intention of law and void. Under Issue No. 7 it was held that the allotment of Government residence was not a vested right of a Government employee but the Government officers were bound to adhere to law and decide the matters upon pure merits, therefore, application made prior in time should have been given first opportunity which criteria was not fulfilled in this case therefore the said issue was decided accordingly.
  7. In appeal filed by respondents No. 1 and 2 the lower appellate Court reversed the findings of the trial Court on Issue No. 1. It was held that the present suit was filed a day earlier than the date on which previous suit was withdrawn and dismissed for non-prosecution which was also in respect of different cause of actions. Since findings on other issues by the trial Court had been recorded in favour of respondents 1 and 2/plaintiffs therefore after reversing the findings on Issue No. 1 on the basis of which suit was dismissed by the trial Court, the appellate Court without discussing and examining the correctness or otherwise of the findings on other issues, given by the trial Court mechanically proceeded to decree the suit through judgment dated 17-11-1996 after setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court on acceptance of appeal which has been assailed in this revision petition.
  8. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that before the lower appellate Court it was argued on behalf of the petitioner that findings on other issues recorded by the trial Court were not valid and liable to be reversed but the same were not examined on the ground that the petitioner did not file cross objections. On the same reasons, learned counsel for respondents No. 1 and 2 during the arguments opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner.
  9. Order 41 Rule 22 C.P.C. provides that a respondent in appeal could file cross objections against judgment and decree of the Trial Court in a case where an appeal could be filed by him in order to seek modification of the decree. It was not a case where the present petitioner/respondent in appeal before the lower appellate Court could either file appeal against judgment and decree of the trial Court the same being a decree of dismissal of the suit as a whole as such he was not bound to file cross objections whereas under the same provisions of law, he could support the judgment and decree of the trial Court for dismissal of the suit oft, other issues decided against him by showing during the arguments without filing cross-objections that the other issues had not been correctly decided and if findings on those issues were reversed the decree for dismissal of suit passed by the trial Court could be maintained if not for the reasons given by the trial Court on Issue No. 1 but on other issues. The lower appellate Court therefore should have examined the findings on the other issues challenged on behalf of the petitioner during the arguments as the same could be challenged without filing cross objections as no formal cross objections in these circumstances merely to challenge the correctness of findings on any issue were required-to be filed, for findings on a particular issue where the final judgment was in favour of a party could not be challenged by filing appeal but decree already passed in favour of such a party could be shown to be justifiable on the other issues also which had been decided against him.
  10. The trial Court held under Issue No.7 that no Government official or servant could claim as a matter of right allotment of a Government accommodation. This finding is correct and in accordance with the established law. That being so it could not be held that-merely because application of one Government servant was earlier in time seeking allotment of a quarter the same must have been allotted to him. As while making allotment of Government accommodation apart from the date of making application by different Government servants the authorities were required to take into consideration other factors the most important being as to which of the employees or Government servant was more in the need of a house or Government accommodation as against the other. During the arguments, learned counsel for respondents No. 1 and 2 did not deny that the father of respondent No. 1 is also a Government servant who has already been allotted a Government accommodation. His brother Tanvir who is unmarried, is also a Government servant and has got Government quarter allotted. The contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that respondent No. 1 who is residing with his brother Tanvir who has no family members, was not at present in immediate need of a government quarter therefore, the present petitioner who was without any house to provide shelter to his family, was rightly allotted this house which could not be held to be unfair or unjust or to suffer from any mala fide has force. In these circumstances, it was not open to the Trial Court to substitute its own decision as regards merit position of both the applicants for the allotment of a Government accommodation for there is no vested right under the law in any Government servant to claim allotment of Government accommodation and if in these circumstances the functionaries of the State found petitioner more eligible, deserving and needy as compared to respondent No. 1, the same could not have been interfered with or held mala fide as such the findings on Issues Nos.6, 7 and 3 are hereby reversed acid the said issues are decided in favour of the petitioner.
  11. The judgment dated 17-11-1996 passed by the lower appellate Court and the findings of the trial Court on Issues Nos.6, 7 and 3 suffer from material irregularities amounting to illegality therefore, this revision petition is accepted, judgment dated 17-11-1996 passed by lower appellate Court is set aside and the dismissal of the suit through judgment dated 30-5-1996 passed by the trial Court is maintained on the findings on Issues Nos.3, 6 and 7 as observed above. The parties are left to bear their own costs.

  JUDGMENT
  MUHAMMAD RAZA KHAN (MEMBER).---The facts lying in the background of this appeal are that a House No.388-E, Street No.58,G-6/4, Islamabad (hereinafter referred to as the subject house) was likely to be vacated and the appellant was the person who initially requested the Minister for Housing and Works on 31-5-1995 for its allotment. The appellant is Section Officer in BPS-17 in the Ministry of Defence and entitled to ' E' type accommodation. He was already in possession of a quarter of lower category. The respondent No.l, issued a directive on 6-6-1995 to respondent No.2 in these words:
  ""I am directed to refer to this Division's letter of even number dated 31-5-1995, on the above-cited subject and to say that Secretary, Housing arc'. Works has desired that quarter No-27-E, ST.58,F-6/4, Islamabad may be allotted to Mr. Javed Iqbal, Section Officer, Ministry of Defence, Pakistan Secretariat II, Islamabad in super session of all previous orders.
  You are requested to take further appropriate action in the matter accordingly.""
  This letter was supplemented by yet another letter issued by responder: No. l on 3-10-1995, which is also reproduced hereinbelow:
  ""In continuation of this office order dated 6-6-1995, I am directed to say that the competent Authority has desired to allot House No.388-E, Street 58, G-6!4, Islamabad, to Mr. Javed Iqbal, Section Officer, M/o Defence, Rawalpindi, on subject to vacation basis.
  2. You are directed to take appropriate action in the matter accordingly, under intimation to the undersigned for compliance to the higher authority.
  It appears that respondent No. 2 did not issue any formal allotment order despite these two directives by the concerned' Division of the Federal Government. It also appears that as per evil practice prevailing in the department, a letter from a Private Secretary to the Minister was manipulated on 28-6-1995 and promptly an allotment order was issued by respondent No.2 on 3-7-1995 in favour of respondent No. 3. This respondent No. 3 was an Assistant in B-11, holding selection grade of B-1S and entitled to 'D' type accommodation as per Pakistan Allocation Rules, 1993. Prior to this allotment order, dated 3-7-1995, she was already in possession of another E' type accommodation in I-8/ 1, Islamabad. Only six days after the said allotment, the said respondent No. 3 moved a civil suit in the Civil Court at Islamabad on 9-7-1995 for getting an injunction to the effect that the said allotment order may neither be superseded nor the house be allotted to some one else. It appears that ' D' type house in possession of the appellant was allotted to one Mr. pervaiz Akhtar on 17-6-1996 by respondent No. 2, presumably on the basis of the order of respondent No. 1 dated 6-6-1995 for the allotment of subject house to the appellant and in consequence whereof the house already in his possession was further allotted to Pervaiz Akhtar in -response to the directive of the Works Division The Estate Office (respondent No.2) informed the said Division that the subject house will be allotted to the appellant on vacation of the house. It further appears that the appellant vacated his house and occupied the subject house. The respondent No, 3 got an ex parte decree in her favour from the Civil Court without impleading the appellant as a party. The appellant, thereafter, filed an appeal and got himself impleaded in the said suit. The ex parte order was consequently set aside and the case was remanded for fresh trial. Despite the present litigation, the said suit filed by respondent No. 3 is still pending in the Civil Court. Side by side with these developments, respondent No. 2 issued a notice of ejectment on 21-5-1996 and allegedly pasted the same on the door of the subject house (in possession of the appellant) directing him to hand over the vacant possession of the said accommodation, within certain hours, failing which possession will be obtained by force. This ejectment notice has been challenged by the appellant in the present service appeal with the request that the said notice may be vacated and the respondent No. 2 be directed to issue a formal allotment order of the subject house in favour of the appellant.
  2. The official respondents as well as private respondent No. 3 contested the appeal by filing written objections. We have listened to the arguments and examined the record. The request of the appellant for temporary injunction was also considered and the impugned order x as suspended till the disposal of main appeal.
  3. Prior to the discussion on the merits of the appeal, it is necessary to handle the preliminary legal objection with regard to the jurisdiction in the matters of allocation of accommodation to the civil servants. Normally, a civil servant can file service appeal against his employer department for violation of any terms and conditions of service. The appellant was an employee of the Government of Pakistan posted in the Ministry of Defence as Section Officer, and private respondent No. 3 was an employee of the Corporate Law Authority. The Works Division was not, the employer division of either of them. The Pakistan Allocation Rules, 171 were in the shape of administrative instructions issued by the Ministry of Works for regulating the process of allocation etc. of Government accommodation to civil servants and, therefore, this Tribunal had not interfered in the questions of allocation of accommodation. However, in 1993 the earlier rules were repealed and fresh Allocation Rules were promulgated with the approval of the President and in exercise of the powers under section 25 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973. Thus, from 1993 the allocation of accommodation had become a part of the terms and conditions of service of the civil servants falling within the scope of the said Rules. Therefore, the jurisdiction of any other institution or forum was barred under Article 212 of the Constitution.
  The practice of filing civil suits and getting injunction, in connivance with the officials of respondent No.2 was an extra-Constitutional measure. We have noticed in several cases that certain employees of the Federal Government approached the Civil Court with a declaratory suit and got a temporary injunction which continued indefinitely in certain cases. Most of such suits are filed at the instance of the officials of the Estate Office (respondent No.2). The respondent No.2 either concedes the issue before the Civil Court of allows the decision to be made in favour of a particular person by default on the part of the Estate Office. This is arranged either by delay in filing written statements, replies or delay in engaging a counsel to defend the Estate Office. In certain other cases, the representative of the Estate Office even conceded for the grant of temporary injunction in favour of a particular allottee. Thus, on one hand, the officials of respondent No.2 fail to perform their functions impartially by showing extra favour to certain allottees and thereby strengthening the general feeling of certain motives behind the allotments. On the other hand, by this attitude the representative of the Estate Office fail to properly assist the Civil Courts and thereby defeat the clear provisions of the Constitution. We were told at the bar that the High Court has issued instructions to the Civil Courts not to entertain the declaratory suits from the civil servants relating to allocation of accommodation in accordance with Allocation Rules, 1993 on the ground that it has become a part of the terms and conditions of service falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Service Tribunal. However, by active connivance and positive concealment, the officials of respondent No.2 succeed in the manipulation of temporary injunctions from the Civil Courts in violation of the directive of the High Court and in derogation of the provisions of the Constitution.
  4. The instant case is a typical example of such connivance and active participation in getting a decree in favour of respondent No.3. As stated earlier, the Works Division issued direction for the allotment of subject house to the appellant on 6-6-1995. The respondent No.2 did not bother to comply with the said direction issued by its controlling Division, under the Rules of Business. In the meanwhile, the information appears to have been passed on to arrange a letter from an official of the Minister and thereupon the Estate Office hurriedly issued the allotment order on 3-7-1995 in favour of respondent No.3 and within a period of less than a week, the said respondent No.3 succeeded in getting an injunction from the Civil Court at Islamabad without having any cause of action. Not only the injunction was passed but the case was heard and decided within a couple of weeks without any effort on the part of the Estate Office to disclose the lack of jurisdiction of the Civil Court in the terms and conditions of service of the civil servants and without intimation of the fact that the appellant was a necessary party to the said suit. Such an attitude amounts to collusion instead of mere concealment or negligence. The respondent No. 3 was already in occupation of a house above her entitlement, and succeeded in getting the formal allotment letter of the subject house from respondent No.2 to the prejudice of the rights of the appellant and within a couple of days of the said allotment, she got the stay orders from the Civil Court without having any cause or grievance. She did not implead the appellant as a party and tried to mislead the Court. Even during the proceedings before this Tribunal, she was given an option to consider the withdrawal of her case from the Civil Court for the appropriate adjudication of her rights with that of the appellant by this Tribunal. However, she did nor concede to withdraw the same. Therefore, the issue of adjudication of her rights for the allotment of the subject house is not before this Tribunal. So, in brief, we hold that after the enforcement of the Allocation Rules of 1993 with the approval of the President in exercise of his powers under section 25 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, the question of allotment of accommodation has become a part of the terms and conditions of service of the civil servants and thus falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of this Tribunal in accordance with Article 212 of the Constitution.
  5. It was argued on behalf of the respondents that there was no allotment order in favour of the appellant and, therefore, he was in wrongful possession of the subject house and the impugned order has been issued in accordance with the power vested in the respondent No.2. We are at a failure to appreciate the argument for the sole reason that respondent No.2 was neither an autonomous authority nor was vested with any statutory power.. Under the Rules of Business of 1973, respondent No.2 was to work under respondent No. 1 and in accordance with the Pakistan Allocation Rules the Minister for Housing and Works was the competent Authority having the reserved quota of 10% and under the Rules of Business, the orders of the Minister were to be executed by respondent No. 1. Therefore, we hold that the orders passed by respondent No. 1 were to be honoured by respondent No. 2 and, therefore, any direction from the Works Division amounted to allotment order and the respondent No. 2 was bound to issue a formal letter of allotment on receipt of such directive. The Private Secretary to Minister had no authority either directly or a delegated one to issue a direction to the respondent No.2 in this regard. Hence the direction issued by the respondent No. 1 on 6-6-1995 was not only prior in time but was also passed by a competent ,Authority than the one issued on 28-6-1995 in favour of respondent No. 3. Moreover, there is no claim that the said directive of 6-6-1995 was not received by respondent No. 2. It was certainly received by respondent No. 2, and that is why the ' D' type accommodation in possession ' of the appellant was allocated to one Pervaiz Akhtar on 18-6-1995 whereby the accommodation in possession of the appellant was further allocated and it could be deemed to be in compliance with the directive of the Works Division. He, therefore, occupied the subject house on its vacation in anticipation of a formal letter in this regard.
  6. The appellant was entitled to ' E' type accommodation under the Allocation Rules. Such accommodation cannot be allowed to anyone else entitled to a lower category except in the event that no one of the entitled category was available with the request for its allotment. It was contended that respondent No. 3 was already in possession of ' E' type accommodation and on 3-7-1995 the subject house was not allotted to anybody else, therefore, it could be allotted to respondent No. 3 in exchange of her accommodation. We coo not agree with the argument because the wish for better accommodation cannot deprive those entitled to a better category. Comparatively, the appellant was more entitled to the subject house being the accommodation of his category than the respondent No. 3 who was already occupying an accommodation higher than her entitlement.
  7. In view of the above discussion, we accept this appeal, set aside the impugned Notice dated 21-5-1996 read with the allotment order dated 3-7-1995 in favour of respondent No. 3 and direct that the appellant has rightly occupied the subject house in compliance with the direction of the respondent No. l and thus a formal allotment order may be issued in his favour accordingly. No order as to costs.

  ABDUL RAZZAQ A. THAHIM (CHAIRMAN).---I agree with my learned brother Mr. Muhammad Raza Khan, Member and he has dealt with all aspects of the case in detail. I would like to add that in Writ Petition No.475 of 1990 (Safdar Ali Malik v. Estate Officer, Estate Office, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and others), decided on 29-11-1993, the Lahore High Court observed as under:--
  ""As admittedly, the petitioner is a civil servant and is aggrieved of alleged violation of terms and conditions of service, therefore, his remedy is before the relevant Service Tribunal and not before this Court as per provisions of Article 212 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The writ petition is, therefore, dismissed.""
  Therefore, the point has been settled that in such a matter the aggrieved civil servant has got way to come before this Tribunal and I would not like to go into the controversy that the concurrent jurisdiction is being exercised by other forums and it was admitted on behalf of the respondent No. 3 during the course of arguments that declaratory suit is still pending in the Civil Court. Whatever the case may be the Civil Court has got its own jurisdiction but while exercising the jurisdiction in civil suits, how care to be taken about the decisions of the superior Courts as quoted in para. 3 of this judgment, when under Article 212 of the Constitution, this Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction in matters of terms and conditions of civil servants, and these are number of judgments of High Courts and Supreme Court.

  JUDGMENT
  ROSHAN ALI MANGI (MEMBER).---Having been aggrieved, by Audit Report, on the accounts of the Mission at Hague for the years 1988-92, whereby an amount of Rs. 72,24439 (equivalent to U.SA. S 3282/LS) was held inadmissible by the Director, Foreign Audit, Islamabad, being 50% of the DA. for 15 days in lieu of the foreign allowance and the house rent allowance, and is, therefore, being recovered from the payment of gratuity of the appellant vide Director, Foreign Audit letter, dated 13th August, 1995, and having been failed to get a positive response from the respondent, on submission of the departmental appeal on 7-12-1994, the appellant has filed this appeal to the Tribunal.
  2. The brief facts of the case as stated in the memo of the appeal are, that, the appellant was transferred to Embassy of Pakistan Hague in January, 1988. He joined the Mission on 28-1-1988. After availing of 6 days joining period under the rules, he was accommodated alongwith his family in a hotel from 28-1-1988 to 31-3-1988.
  3. The appellant was provided with residential accommodation on 1-4-1988.
  4. (On the basis of two precedents, whereby, the Mission had paid full DA. for 15 days for stay in the hotel to Messrs M. Aslam Rizvi in 1986, and Shahryar Rashid in 1989, former Councillors in accordance with rules, No.4/15-63, dated 24-4-1964, and No. 4/13/80, dated 5-11-1981, the appellant submitted representation to the Secretary, Foreign Affairs, Islamabad on 14-10-1988 for non-payment of 15 days DA.
  5. In response the Director-General, Personnel, vide his Telex No. Estt. (II-A)-14/44/73, dated 9-6-1990, instructed the mission to pay DA. in question to the appellant. Despite the instructions according to appellant, the Mission paid only 50% of the DA in lieu of Foreign Allowance and house rent taking hotel as the provision of the Government accommodation, contrary to the instructions issued by the Ministry of Finance vide O.M. No.4(5)-R(II)/76, dated 9-3-1977, wherein the term of accommodation has been clearly defined by Finance Division, as to be suitable.
  6. In the meantime, the appellant was transferred to Ministry of Foreign Affairs and claimed the payment of remaining 50% of DA. as per rules. This was sanctioned by the Ministry vide Sanction Letter No. Estt: (II-A)-4/44/73 dated 21-10-1991.
  7. The appellant appeared in person and argued that the Audit para. 2 of the Audit Team became redundant after the issuance of the sanction letter by the Ministry regarding payment of DA.
  8. In Case No: 127/R of 1990 filed by Major Zia-ul-Haque, the then Director Haj as posted to Jeddah, the Service Tribunal had ordered payment of Full 15 days DA. for stay other than the suitable residential accommodation on the basis of Ministry of Finance O.M. referred above. In view of this decision he should also be paid DA.
  9. He further pleaded that in case, he is not allowed the DA. for days, for not providing the suitable accommodation, then this benefit already allowed to others, should also be recovered from them to apply the rule equally to all.
  10. The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs supported the case of appellant, however, the representative of the Audit, resisted the appeal. The Audit also filed the comments, wherein it has been contended that, the appellant was accommodated in a hotel for the period from 28-1-1988 to 31-3-1988, by the Mission rent also pre-paid, after obtaining the prior approval of the then Ambassador. As the appellant was provided accommodation on his arrival at Hague, therefore, he was not entitled to draw 15 days DA. in lieu of House Rent Allowance and Foreign Allowance from 28-1-1988 to 11-2-1988 in terms of F/A, letter Rules-4/11/68, dated 24-11-1968.
  11. However, the appellant in clear violation of aforementioned orders, following payment on account of 15 days DA in lieu of House Rent Allowance and Foreign Allowance, was paid at a belated stages.---

    12. It is further stated, that, the payment of 15s days DA., in lieu of Foreign Allowances, and House Rent Allowance was refused by the Head of the Mission on 26-8-1988, 12-2-1990 and again on 19-4-1991. The mysterious circumstances, under which the official managed to draw 50% of DA. for 15 days at Hague after the lapse of period of two and half years is not known to Audit. It has been vehemently contended that the claim was not only irregular, but also time-barred. Mission authorities were, therefore, not competent to make payment of .the time-barred TA./DA claims of the official. The payment was also against the instructions issued to all the Head of Missions abroad by the Director General (Ministry), Ministry of Foreign Affairs vide No.Rule-4/13/80 dated 5-11-19'81. .
  13. It has further been pointed that appellant was transferred from Hague to Islamabad in June, 1994. He made a representation for the payment of balance 50% of DA for 15 days in lieu of house rent allowance and foreign allowance. His case was processed vide para. 233 of the office note. It was proposed to refer the case to the Mission for its settlement under the rules. This proposal was approved by the Director P-1I, on 15-7-1991 instead of referring the case to the Parep Hague, the Section Officer, Mrs. Iffit Khalid issued sanction vide No. Estt. (II-A)/4-44/73, dated 21-10-1991, allowing the appellant to draw 15 days DA. at full rate from 28-1-1988 to 12-2-1988. This action of the Section Officer was not covered by the administrative order of the competent Authority.
  14. The appellant, was granted full DA. for the joining period of 6 days, on joining the Hague Mission on 28-1-1988. Thereafter, he was put in Hotel and its rent pre-repaid by the Mission with approval of the then Ambassador, since the residential accommodation at that time was not readily available, the appellant accepted not only the hotel accommodation, but also the Foreign 'Allowance.
  15. This action on the part of the Mission was in accordance with the instructions contained in official letter dated 5-11-1981, the relevant portion of the letter is reproduced below:-
  ""It is reiterated that provision of accommodation is the responsibility of the Mission, and the direct responsibility of the Heads of Mission whose decision in each case is final. Should an official refuse to accept the accommodation approved by the Head of Mission, the requirement of providing official accommodation having been met, the consequences must be faced by the official himself including disciplinary action for defying official orders.""
  16. From the above it becomes clear that, the action of the Mission was according to instruction, as such in order. The accommodation so provided in fact was not permanent, but rather stop-gap arrangement. The official ultimately was provided the required suitable accommodation after about 2 and half months.
  17. The necessity of providing the temporary accommodation arose because, as explained in the said letter reproduced below:
  ""It came to the notice of authorities that, in certain cases, the officials tried to delay acquiring of accommodation with intention to misuse the facility of daily allowance in lieu of Government Accommodation and Foreign Allowance. There were instances in which official accommodation had been acquired immediately after drawing the daily allowance for 15 days. The authorities also came across cases in which the accommodation was surrendered on one pretext or the other to enable the incoming officials to get the facility of daily allowance.""
  18. The appellant, has relied upon Ministry of Foreign Affairs No.M(11) 25/1/55, dated 12-7-1955 and No.Rules-4/15/63, dated 24-2-1964 for claiming the full DA. for 15 days. The relevant extract is reproduced below:--
  ""SI. No.97-(i) It has been decided that an officer or member of the Staff who is unable to find suitable residential accommodation immediately on his arrival at the new post is entitled to draw daily allowance in lieu of Foreign Allowance for himself, wife and children above 12 years at full rate and one half for children above 12 months for a period not exceeding 28 days (reduced to 15 days vide Ministry of Foreign Affairs No.Rules-4/11/67, dated 11-12-1971).""
  19. However, the experience showed that this facility was being misused.
  This has been expressed in Tiara 3 of Foreign Affairs Circular No.12/17/75, dated 3-8-1976 (SL No.1983, (reproduced below)-.--
  ""It has been observed that the facility is often misused. The official generally stay in hotel and draw DA. for full 15 days period and move to the residential accommodation secured for them immediately thereafter.
  It would be readily appreciated that this attitude is against the spirit and the intention underlying the concession in question and runs counter to financial canons and proprieties. It results in substantial expenditure from public exchequer which could be avoided if due care was taken to ensure the residential accommodation for new arrivals in Missions was arranged without unnecessary loss of time before hand.""
  It was, therefore, advised vide para. 4 of the said circular:-
  ""In cases of replacement of officials the allotments occupied by the out going official should be retained for the incoming officials after receiving orders in each cases, from the Ministry so that latter have to stay in hotels only during the overlapping period.""
  It was further advised vide para 6 of the said circular:--
  ""6. The utmost care and economy must be observed in this regard and the procedure outlined in para. 4 above followed miticulously.""
  19. The letter dated 5-11-1981 mentioned above was the follow up of the previous communications in which, the Head of the Mission was made competent to decide, the temporary accommodation for the incoming officials, till, a permanent, suitable accommodation could be arranged.
  20. The Hotel accommodation so provided to the appellant; for which, the rent was paid by the Mission, with prior approval of the former Ambassador, was in accordance with instructions contained in the said letter. As such he was not entitled to draw 15 days DA., in lieu of the house rent allowance and foreign allowance for the period from 28-1-1988 to 12-2-1988. The Audit has rightly pointed, that the DA: in question was not permissible under the latest rules.
  21. However, the appellant, although during his stay in the hotel accepted the Foreign Allowance, later on demanded the 15 days DA. which the Mission refused rightly to pay vide letter dated 13-10-1988 stating therein, that, ""Mr. Asghar Ali, Additional Assistant is informed that the accommodation to lodge him and his family for a period from 28-1-1988 to 31-3-1988 was hired as per rules and that the Ministry has held that you are not entitled to daily allowance for 15 days,"" and his attention was drawn to Ministry Circular dated 5-11-1981.
  22. After some time, the appellant changed his stand and addressed a letter dated 8-2-1990, to the Head of the Mission Hague, stating therein, the circumstances, under which he was accommodated in hotel for about two months; and further stated as reproduced below:-
  ""I did not claim full DA as the advance rents were paid by the Mission. I am, therefore, under the rules entitled to 50% DA. in lieu of Foreign Allowance (for non-provision of suitable residential accommodation) for stay in hotel which may kindly be ordered to be paid to me in accordance with the Ministry's decision dated 4-1-1990 to mitigate my hardships and suffering from more than two years.""
  23. In response, the Chancery informed the appellant vide letter dated 12-2-1990, that, the accommodation so provided should be treated as a case of provision of accommodation envisaged under para. 5 of the even number dated 5-11-1980. No DA., therefore, seem to be due.
  24. However, the appellant managed to get 50% of the DA. amounting to S 3280.15, by the Mission through getting it issued instructions by the Ministry by telex in June, 1990, after the lapse of 2-1/2 years, although it was not in order under the rules it should have been claimed within a year and as such needed the approval of the competent Authority, but no such rules were observed.
  25. After his return to Pakistan the appellant wrote a letter dated 16-1-1991, to the Section Officer, Establishment (II-A), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating therein that, he was paid only 50% of DA. for stay in the Hotel at the instructions of the Ministry and further requesting that he might be paid full DA., as per rules on the analogy of the DA. paid by Mission to M/s. M. Aslam Rizvi and Shahryar Rashid, Councillors respectively on their stay in hotels. He further stated in the said letter, that if it was not possible to pay to him full DA. 'as per rules, then he would request that the 50% DA. was recovered from M/s. Aslam and Shahryar Rashid in conformity with said rules for justice and fairplay.
  26. The record shows that Section Officer concerned submitted the case to the Director on 14-7-1991 vide para. 232-33/N of the file. In these paras Section Officer Establishment (II-A) proposed to ask Parep the Hague to settle the claim of the appellant as admissible under the rules. This para was approved by the Director in writing ""as proposed."" Parep the Hague vide their Letter NoAdmn.2/6/79-II, dated 19-4-1991 refused to make payment.
  27. Although the Head of Mission' decision in the case of accommodation was final, therefore, once again the Mission refused to pay TA. bills once settled cannot be re-opened at any level, but then the Section Officer issued sanction letter bearing number Estt. (II-A)-4/44/73 dated 21 10-1991, allowing remaining 50% of the DA amounting to S 317150 to the appellant, stating therein ""this issues with the approval of the competent Authority"", although record shows, that it has not been approved by the competent Authority. As such the appellant drew full DA for 15 days amounting to S 6453.65.
  28. After examining all the aspects of the case, we come to the conclusion, that, the appellant was provided accommodation with approval of the Head of the Mission, who was the competent Authority under the rules as per instructions contained in letter dated 5-11-1981. The appellant lived in the hotel and accepted the Foreign Allowance until, he got the suitable residential accommodation as such he was not entitled to the DA for 15 days and was rightly declared not permissible by the Audit under the rules. Later on he agitated and claimed initially for 50% DA for 15. days, which was refused first by the Mission as well as by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, the appellant later on managed to get remaining 50% of the DA. also although no competent Authority had approved it.
  29. This claim was not only against the instruction contained in the Ministry circular dated 5-11-1981, but also was paid after a period of 2-1/2 years as such was not permissible under the rules. Besides this TA. Bill once settled cannot be re-opened at any time. Its settlement needs the approval of the Ministry of Finance.
  30. This is very stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been supporting the appellant all along despite the fads that it issued some instructions according to which, the claim in question was neat permissible but it issued other instructions to the Mission to pay appellant 50% of DA. in violation of its previous instructions and paid remaining 50% of DA. without observing rules. As such they violated the same instructions which were issued to the Mission to be complied with. This could be because they have been committing such irregularities in other cases as well, which the appellant, exploited to his benefit by quoting them, just to hide those cases. The appellant was allowed DA. which was not admissible under the rules as was in other cases. Authorities may like to look into the matter.
  31. For the reasons stated above, we do not find any merit in the case, and therefore, we dismiss the appeal with no order as to costs.
  32. Parties be informed.
  H.B.T./1098/Sr.F Appeal dismissed.

  Ch. Mushtaq Masood for Appellants.
  A.G. Humayun, District Attorney and Muhammad Aslam Virk for Respondents.
  Date of hearing: 18th April, 1988.
    JUDGMENT
  KH. MUHAMMAD YOUSAF (MEMBER).‑‑This order shall dispose of the appeals of Miss Khalida Khatoon Malik, Deputy Director (HQ), Acting Joint Director, Social Welfare Department, Lahore and Muhammad Mushtaq, Deputy Director, Social Welfare, Lahore Appeal Nos.754/249 of 1987 and 753/248 of 1987, respectively, filed by them under section 4 of the Punjab Service Tribunals Act, 1974 having impleaded the above‑mentioned as respondents.
  2. By virtue of these appeals the appellants have impugned the Government of the Punjab, Social Welfare and Zakat Department's Notification dated 24‑8‑1987 whereby Mrs. Aqeela Asghar Ali, Deputy Director, Social Welfare (BPS 18) was granted pro forma promotion w.e.f. 4‑10‑1976 and was assigned seniority as Deputy Director above Miss Khalida Khatoon Malik and Muhammad Mushtaq, the appellants.
  3. Briefly stated the facts, having given rise to seniority dispute between Miss Khalida Khatoon Malik and Muhammad Mushtaq and Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali respondent on the other hand, are that the appellants and Miss Aquila Asghar Ali were selected as Social Welfare Officers by the Punjab Public Service Commission for regular appointment in the year 1963. The seniority in the order of merits was assigned by the Public Service Commission and the appellants were placed below the contesting respondent Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali. The other facts admitted by the parties are that bliss Khalida Khatoon Malik was promoted as Field Officer in 1967 and further promoted as Ass1st ant Director in 1970 and then as Dy. Director in the year 1976 (BPS 18). The other appellant Muhammad Mushtaq was promoted as Field Officer in 1966 and further promoted as Ass1st ant Director in 1970 and was further promoted as Deputy Director (BPS 18) in 1976. As regards contesting respondent Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali, she was promoted as Research Officer in 1969 and further promoted as Ass1st ant Director in 1970. In 1976 her name was considered for promotion alongwith others as Deputy Director (BPS 18) but she was not approved for promotion on account of her unsatisfactory record of service.
  4. Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali has chequered record of service and did not have smooth sailing in her service career upto the relevant date i.e., 1976. She earned adverse reports for the years 1965, 1972, 1973 and 1975. She was also involved in a corruption case. She was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment till rising of Court and also to a fine of Rs.10,000 by the Senior Special Judge, Anti-?Corruption, Lahore. Her case for promotion as Dy. Director (BPS 18) in the year 1980 was again ignored on account of Anti‑Corruption case. She made appeal to the Honourable Lahore High Court against her conviction. Her appeal was accepted and she was acquitted by the Lahore High Court. Then again in 1982 her case for promotion was considered but this time she was cleared and promoted in BPS 18 w.e.f. 28‑8‑1982. She applied to the Honourable Minister for Social Welfare and Zakat Department, Punjab, Lahore for the grant of pro forma promotion w.e.f. the date her juniors were promoted. Consequently the appellant was promoted and granted pro forma promotion through the impugned order (which is subject‑matter of the appeal) w.e.f. 4‑10‑1976 vide Government Notification dated 24‑8‑1987 and was made senior to the appellants. The appellants have challenged‑ the said order before this Tribunal.
  5. After preliminary hearing, the appeals were admitted for regular hearing and notices were sent to the respondents who have filed the written objections controverting the averments of the appellants.
  6. The appellants have assailed the impugned order mainly on the following grounds:‑
  (i) That the impugned order for the grant of pro forma promotion to the respondent Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali was against the rules and was managed by her through fraud and misrepresentation.
  (ii) That the appellants were not heard before their seniority above the respondent Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali was disturbed and changed by relegating the appellants as junior to contesting respondent.
  7. On the contrary the respondents have filed their written objections and have taken the plea that it was a case of promotion and the Tribunal's jurisdiction was barred under section 4 of the Punjab Service Tribunal's Act, 1974 and it was further asserted by the respondents that the impugned order granting pro forma promotion and, seniority to the contesting respondent is in conformity with the law.
  8. We have made deep appraisal of the entire record and attendant circumstances of the case. It is admitted fact that Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali retained seniority over the appellants since her regular appointment by the Punjab Public Service Commission in 1963 till 3‑10‑1976. Thereafter she was not approved for promotion and was superseded and therefore, the appellants became senior to her.
  9. In 1987 Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali .was allowed pro forma promotion disturbing the existing seniority of the appellants as she resultantly became senior to them. This was also clearly stated in the impugned order. This impugned order is a subject‑matter of this appeal and the appellants have invoked the jurisdiction of this Tribunal with a prayer to set aside this Notification.
  10. The first point raised by the respondents challenging the jurisdiction. of this Tribunal requires determination first. The respondents have relied upon the proviso (1) B of section 4 of the Punjab Service Tribunals Act, 1974 which‑ reads as under:‑
  ""4(1)(b) no appeal shall lie to a Tribunal against an order or decision of a departmental authority determining the fitness or otherwise of a person to be appointed to or hold a particular post or to be promoted to a higher grade.""
  The point involved is the determination of the seniority of the contesting parties. The seniority of the appellants, abruptly, has been disturbed after 11 years. This Tribunal can go into the question of legality of the pro forma promotion order for determination of the seniority point involved in this case. Furthermore, the fitness to promotion is distinguishable from the eligibility to promotion. In these appeals the question for fitness to promotion is not involved at all as the contesting respondent already stood promoted since 1982. The question for determination is the legality of the respondent's pro forma promotion under the rules. In such cases this Tribunal has plenary and unfettered jurisdiction to go into the question to determine if the promotion order is in accordance with the law. We are fortified in our view by the decisions of Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan as reported:‑
  1983 S C M R 74; 1984 S C M R 1051; 1984 S C M R 1459 and 1985 S C M R 699.
  In the mentioned cases the Supreme Court of Pakistan had upheld the decision of Federal Service Tribunal whereby the Tribunal had interfered with the recommendations of Promotion Committee in particular circumstances. This Tribunal has also given the detailed judgment in this behalf as reported in 1984 P L C 842 titled. Shaukat Ali v. Safdar which was upheld by the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the above referred case 1984 S C M R 1.459. The Lahore High Court is also in support of our views. The view has been expressed by the Lahore High Court in case of Muhammad Sharif and 6 others v. Secretary, Irrigation and Power. Department reported as 1981 P L C (C.S.) 562. The relevant para. reads as under:‑
  ""7. Section 4 of the said Act does not oust the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the matter of all questions relating to promotion. It is only the question of fitness for promotion which cannot be agitated before the Tribunal. As explained above, the petitioners have not been declared unfit for promotion due to any reason, such as general reputation for corruption, but have been found not eligible for promotion because they have not cleared the departmental examination. As stated above the question of fitness for promotion cannot be gone into by the Tribunal but the question of eligibility for promotion can be determined by the Tribunal. This view was also recently expressed by a Division Bench of‑ this Court in an unreported judgment delivered in Intra‑Court appeal No.644 of 1981, Syed Ahsan Ali Bokhari: v. Director of Labour Welfare etc.""
  10‑A ‑In view of the above we are of the considered opinion that 'proviso 4(1)(b) of the Punjab Service. Tribunals Act, 1974 vis‑a‑vis the facts.. of this case is not applicable. The plea of the respondent has no force and this Tribunal has jurisdiction to go into all relevant questions to adjudicate upon the rights of the parties.
  11. The next point for determination is, whether the order of granting pro .forma promotion to the respondent is in, conformity with the law.
  It is admitted fact and also borne out from the record that respondent Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali's representation against the expunction of adverse remarks, was rejected by the Government. According to rules only one representation lies against the expunction of adverse remarks. It is not intelligible oil comprehensible as how the Secretary Local Govt. and Social Welfare Department accepted the second representation of the respondent and ordered the expunction of adverse remarks when her representation. in this behalf was already rejected by the Government. Even the power to review his own order or the order of his predecessor did not vest in Secretary regarding the expunction of adverse remarks.
  12. It is borne out from the record that Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali, the contesting respondent earned adverse reports for the years 1965, 1972, 1973 and 1975 prior to the relevant date i.e., year 1976 when she was allowed pro forma promotion. Her adverse report for the year 1965 stood intact. Her adverse remarks for the year 1975 were partially expunged while her representation against the expunction of adverse remarks for the years 1972 and 1973 were rejected. It is also established from the record that Secretary, Local Govt. and Social Welfare Department in the year 1977 by one stroke of pen expunged the adverse remarks of the said two years. We have examined the order of Secretary in this behalf. The order does not disclose the reasons or causes for entertaining the second representation for expunction of adverse remarks or for reviewing the earlier order whereby the respondent's representation was rejected. It has been vehemently argued by the appellants that the order of. Secretary expunging the adverse remarks illegally was managed' by the contesting respondent through fraudulent means and this order is illegal and untenable in law.
  13. On the other hand the respondents in their written objections have taken the plea that the Secretary, Local Government and Social Welfare Department was competent to entertain the second representation and to review his earlier order rejecting the respondent's representation for expunction of adverse remarks. They have based the plea on the ground that it was in the year 1984 when the SGA & I Department issued instructions that only one representation against the expunction of adverse remarks was maintainable and the power to review was not available to expunging authority. It has been urged by the respondents that the adverse remarks were expunged by the Secretary, Local Government and Social Welfare Department in the year 1977 while the instructions placing embargo came into force in the year 1984. The position taken by the respondents is not factually correct as the position was the same prior to year 1984. The Government instructions in this behalf were issued by the S.GA & I Department No.SORII (S&GAD) 2‑52/73, dated 16th October, 1973 addressed to all the Departments. The relevant portion reads as under:
  ""6. As regards expunction of adverse remarks (item (iii), instructions have already been issued‑‑vide this Department's circular, letter NO.SJRIII (SP‑GAD)11‑2/73, dated the 9th June, 1973 that only one representation will lie and the decision taken on it would be absolutely final. The representation has to be submitted not later than one month from the date of communication of adverse remarks. Pro forma promotion‑ should be given only if the supersession of the official was based entirely on the adverse remarks which were later oh found to be unmerited and therefore, expunged. If there were any other factors going against the official or the adverse remarks were only partially expunged, pro forma promotion should not be granted.""
  14. The position in the year 1977 was the same and we are of the considered opinion that the Secretary, Local Government and Social Welfare Department was not competent to allow the second representation against the expunction of adverse remarks which was already rejected by the Government and was also not competent td review his earlier order. Thus, the Secretary, Local Government and Social Welfare Department has acted against the law and rules. It is well‑settled law as laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as 1981 S C M R 244 that if the .law requires the matter to be done in a certain manner, it should be done in such a manner and none other.
  15. We may observe here that the original file expunging the adverse remarks by the Secretary L3&SW Department has not been produced before us. The same has been withheld by the Department on the ground that the same was not traceable. The photostat copy duly attested by the Under Secretary issued by Mr. Javed Dastgir Mirza Section Officer‑V, for Secretary reads as under:
  ""Government of the Punjab,
  Local Government Social Welfare and
  Rural Development Department.

Superintendent Mothers' and
Children Home, Lahore.
  Memo: No.SOV‑SW‑II‑I‑39/73

  Subject:‑ Expunction of Adverse Remarks.
  With reference to the above noted subject, kindly refer to your representation dated 22‑1‑1974.

  (Sd.)
Javed Dastgir Mirza
Section Officer V,
for Secretary.""
  As the original file has been withheld by the Department the possibility cannot be ruled out that the then Secretary LG&SW Department might have not passed the order expunging the remarks. In the absence of such file it cannot be looked into as what were the compelling circumstances under which the Secretary LG&SW Department, had to expunge the remarks when the representation to that effect had already been rejected by his predecessor. The withholding of the file also gives adverse presumption against the respondent as the Department appears to be all help for Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali. The Department has produced before us the file containing the copies of several documents attested by the Under Secretary (Estt.) Government of the Punjab, SW& Zakat Department. The above referred letter issued by the Section Officer ""for Secretary"" also is not free from doubt. It refers to the representation of Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali whereas it is manifested from the record that Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali made second representation for adverse remarks in the year 1977. The file containing attested copies produced by the Department has been retained as a part of the file of appeal of Miss Khalida Khatoon Malik which shall be returned after disposal of the appeal by the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan if any.
  16. In the light of the above discussion, we are of the considered opinion that the Secretary, SW&LG Department acted illegally and in contravention of rules and instructions having force of law. His order expunging the adverse remarks of contesting respondent Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali is without jurisdiction and lawful authority, nullity in law and of no legal effect. The remarks expunged by him shall be deemed to have never been expunged in the eye of law. Legally the order of ~ Secretary LG & SW Department vitiates the pro forma promotion order of the contesting respondent Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali.
  We have observed another illeg4.lity in the impugned pro forma promotion order. The contesting respondent Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali could be allowed promotion on the basis of her service record prior to 1976. The record prior to relevant date contained as many as four adverse entries against her. We have gone through the working paper for the grant of pro forma promotion to Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali wherein the Secretary, SW and Zakat Department has recommended that ""she may be allowed pro forma promotion as her period of service after 1975 is good‑satisfactory."" This also vitiates the pro forma promotion order of the respondents.
  17. The next illegality observed in the pro forma promotion is that rules require as quoted above that the pro forma promotion could only be allowed if the entire adverse remarks were expunged and if the remarks were partially expunged, such officer/official was not entitled to pro forma promotion. In this case the remarks in the year 1975 were only partially expunged whereas the adverse remarks for the year 1965 stood intact while the adverse remarks for the years 1972‑73 were illegally expunged as discussed above. This is another factor which vitiates the impugned pro forma promotion
  18. We have also observed that the plea of the appellants that the impugned order was managed by Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali through fraud, misrepresentation and suppression of facts is not devoid of force. It is manifest from the record as well as attendant circumstances that the impugned order was managed through circumvention and the facts were deliberately suppressed. We have also appraised the working paper which does not mention the facts that the representation of Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali for the expunction of adverse remarks was firstly rejected and later on the order was reviewed and her adverse remarks were expunged. We are of the opinion that if the facts were not camouflaged the Provincial Selection Board and the competent authority would have arrived at the different conclusion. It is well‑settled law that if the order is based upon fraud and misrepresentation it is no order in the eye of law and. can be interfered with and set aside without hesitation as laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan as reported P L D 1975 S C 331. While examining the file produced by the Department as mentioned above, we have observed a note of the Office regarding the facts of the case regarding pro forma promotion case of Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali which is reproduced here under:‑
  ""FACTS OF THE CASE PERTAINING TO PRO FORMA PROMOTION CASE OF MRS. AQUILA ASGHAR ALI, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, SOCIAL WELFARE.
  In the pro forma promotion case of Mrs. Aqila Asghar Ali, Deputy Director, Social Welfare which is pending with the Government in which she has allegedly claimed pro forma promotion w.e.f. 4‑10‑1976. In such an eventuality the following two officers of the Department are liable to be adversely affected:‑
  1. Miss. Khalida Khatoon Malik.
  2. Mr. Muhammad Mushtaq.
  As a matter of fact she is not entitled under the rules to such promotion for the reasons given below:
  (i) That the above two officers were promoted in Grade 18 in the prescribed manner w.e.f. 4‑10‑1976 whereas Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali was considered alongwith them and others for promotion in Grade 18. During the same year 1976, above two officers were promoted but she was not promoted on account of un‑satisfactory service record as per Notification No. SOV(SW)‑E‑1(108)/76, dated 4‑10‑1976. (copy enclosed). It tantamounts to supersession.
  (ii) She was again considered alongwith few others for promotion in Grade 18 during 1980 but this time her case was deferred on the ground that an Anti‑corruption inquiry case was pending against her before the Senior Special Judge Anti‑Corruption who punished her till rising of the Court as well as fine of Rs.2,000. However,, this decision was set aside by the High Court in an appeal.
  (iii) Finally she was promoted in the prescribed manner by the competent authority w.e.f. 28‑8‑1982 vide Notification NO.SO(S)18‑35/81, dated 28‑8‑1982.
  After her rejection in ' 1976 she submitted representations for the expunction of adverse remarks for the years 1965, 1973 and 1975. These were the adverse remarks on the basis of which she was superseded during 1976. Against these representations, adverse remarks for 1973 were expunged by a successor authority which was not competent to re‑open the case as per Services General Admin1st ration and Information Department instructions NO.SOR‑IV(S&GAD)14‑?/73, dated 12‑1‑1984: It is specifically mentioned here that representations for expunction of adverse remarks for the year 1965, 1973 and 1975, had already been rejected by the competent authority. It is further submitted that adverse remarks for the years 1965 and 1975 are still on her A. C. Rs.
  At this stage further attention of kind officers is also invited to circular No.SOR‑IV(S&GAD)15‑3/84, dated 7th November, 1984 (copy enclosed) para. 2 of which clarifies that while considering the pro forma promotion case the record to be examined is upto the date from which pro forma promotion is claimed. Since she has claimed pro forma promotion w.e.f. 4‑10‑1976 upto which date she possesses two adverse remarks for the years 1965 and 1975, she has absolutely no case for pro forma promotion in 1976.
  It is, therefore, humbly submitted that while considering her, case, the above facts may kindly be kept in mind.
  In the above note the office correctly apprised the concerned authority regarding the factual position which is in consonance with our findings:
  19. In the light of the foregoing discussion we accept the appeal of the appellants and set aside the impugned order and hold that the appellants are senior to Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali, the contesting respondent. The respondents to bear the costs.
  (Sd.)
Members
  MR. IHSANUL HAQ CH.AUDHRY (CHAIRMAN):
  19. 1 have gone through the judgment of learned Members anal fully l agree with their views. However, I would like to emphasize certain legal, aspects of the matter further: A civil servant, who has suffered adverse entry in his A. C. R. has only one remedy at Departmental level. He can make a representation for expunction of adverse remarks. The decision of his representation is 'final order' for the purposes of appeal under section 4 of the Punjab Service Tribunals Not, 1974. This exhausts the jurisdiction of the Authority designated as Expunging Authority. The decision cannot be reopened thereafter at Departmental level under any provision of law, rules or instructions. The relevant instructions read as under:‑
  Rule 42. Expunction of adverse remarks‑‑A person who is communicated adverse remarks can apply for the expunction of such remarks. But this should be done not later than one month from the date of receipt of the communication. The representation must be made in temperate and dignified language and no allegations of personal and malicious nature should be made indiscreetly and irresponsible allegations against Reporting Officers will result in disciplinary action.
  42‑A. An officer/ official adversely reported upon will have only one right of making a representation and absolute finality would attach to the decision taken thereon, whether in favour of the officer or against. The decision on representation for expunction of adverse remarks should be taken within 90 days of the making of representation. The orders of the expunging authority will not be subject to review by the successor authorities.""
  43. All representations about expunction of adverse remarks will be made to the authority designated as expunging authority under these instructions.
  Provided that in cases where no expunging authority has been designated the representation shall be made to the authority next above the officer recording countersigning the remarks last of all.
  Provided further that where Governor is the initiating authority or the last countersigning authority a review petition shall be made to the Governor.
  43‑A. If the appointing authority is the initiating authority/ countersigning authority of a Govt. servant reported upon representation against the adverse remarks may be made to the next higher authority.""
  20. Now coming to the case in hand Mrs. Aquila Asghar Ali in addition to other adverse reports, had to her discredit reports for the years 1972, 1973 and 1975. It is clear from the record that she availed the right of representation for expunction of these adverse remarks. The representations in respect of adverse reports for the years 1972, 1973 were rejected while representation in respect of remarks for the year 1975 was partially accepted. The said respondent, thereafter did not agitate the matter in any forum. This way she lost her remedy and the orders rejecting her representations became matter of past and a closed transaction.
  21. The Government made the position clear vide Memo. No. SOR.III (S&GAD) 11‑2‑73, dated 9‑6‑1973.‑ The relevant portion reads as under:
  Sub:???? EXPUNCTION OF ADVERSE REMARKS FROM THE ANNUAL
  I am directed to say that cases have come to the notice of Government where the adverse remarks in the. annual confidential reports of officers have been expunged after the lapse of 15 or 20 years. In some cases the representations of the officers for expunction of remarks had been rejected by the authorities who had the occasion to see the performance of the officers and were, therefore in an Ideal position to determine whether or not the adverse remarks were justified. In spite of this the successor authorities have reviewed the earlier decisions and expunged spreading over a number of years by one sweep thus giving rise to claims o pro forma promotion. Government are of the view that this is not a judicious exercise of the discretion vesting in the expunging authorities and have taken the following decisions:‑
  (i) The officers adversely reported upon will have only one right' of making a representation and absolute finality would attach to the decision taken thereon, whether in favour of the officer or against. The decision on representation or expunction of adverse remarks should be taken expeditiously, preferably within 6 months of the making of representation. The orders of the expunging authority will not be subject to review by the successor authorities.""
  This clinches the whole issue. There is no scope, whatsoever, for review or a subsequent representation of any sort. This position was confirmed in the Notification dated 16‑10‑1973 issued, on the subject of grant of pro forma promotion. The learned Members have already reproduced the appellant relevant para in their judgment. This is not all. The case of the respondent for promotion as Deputy Director was not deferred but she was superseded on account of unsatisfactory record vide order dated 4‑10‑1976. Therefore, she lost her seniority over the appellants. It is needless to add here that her representation in respect of adverse reports for the years 1972 and 1973 had already been rejected and decision communicated to her through memos. dated 24‑5‑1974 and 30‑8‑1974. The respondent did not challenge this order in any forum.
  22. The respondent, however, filed a second representation in respect of adverse remarks for the years 1972 and 1973. The same
  ‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑
  Punjab Civil Establishment Code, Part 1, Vol. 1, 1987 page 442. was accepted by the then Secretary, Local Government and Social Welfare as Authority, vide order dated 11‑7‑1977, without bothering to the earlier decision, the competency of second representation and his authority to entertain and decide the‑ representation. As far as the issue of competency of repeated representations or representation not warranted by law is concerned, t have dealt this question at length in my judgment in the appeal of Qazi Ain‑ud‑Din v. Government of the Punjab and one other 1988 P L C (C.S.) 473 with reference to the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as under:‑
  ""The argument is without any merit for the simple reason that not only the final order has been passed but first representation of the appellant after due consideration was also dismissed on 9‑12‑1979. The repeated representations are not warranted by law. In this behalf I can refer to Government of Pakistan v. Bashir Ahmad Khan, reported as P L D 1985 S C 309. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as under:‑
  ""He challenged his first compulsory retirement through a review application filed on 23rd October, 1974, which was decided on 3‑6‑1975. This was the final order passed on review. It could be challenged within 30 days, before the Tribunal under section 4 of the Service Tribunals Act. If the appellant chose not to file an appeal but only to repeat a representation before the same authority who had decided the review, that by itself would not give him another cause of action to file an appeal under section 4. The period spent in making the representation this second or any other representation after the decision of the review application, could not be excluded as of right in counting the period of limitation.""
  The other relevant portion of the judgment reads as under:‑
  ""Same would apply to the appeal arising out of the second compulsory retirement. The review petition filed by the respondent, in that behalf was decided on 13‑6‑1978. Instead of filing an appeal before the Tribunal under section 4 within 30 days of this final order passed on review, he made another representation which caused further delay. The period consumed during the processing of the subsequent representation could not be excluded as of right. And there being no condonation on any good ground by the Tribunal, the appeal filed on 14‑1‑1978 was clearly time‑barred and should have been dismissed accordingly.""
  There is yet another decision of the Supreme Court in Shafaat Ahmad and others v. Government of Punjab and 2 others, reported as 1986 S C M R 30. This decision of the Supreme Court fully covers the proposition involved in the appeal in hand. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as under:‑
  ""There could be three objections to the competency of the appeal including the ground of limitation. The first was that against the order of the Governor no representation at all lay. Therefore, all the time taken in filing the representation, in awaiting its disposal was a time wasted and not condonable. Secondly even where a right of appeal or representation exists it implies one such right and not its repeated exercise. As the order relied upon for extension of limitation is not referable to the first representation but to subsequent one the right of appeal under section 4 of the Tribunal Act came to an end with the filing of first representation and expiry of the period prescribed under section 4 of the Punjab Service Tribunals Act. The third ground is that undue influence and pressure was alleged against Mr. Alimuddin, Secretary Irrigation for avoiding the undertaking. Not only that no such grievance was ever expressed against the officer in any of the representations he was not personally impleaded in the appeal to answer the allegation.""
  In this view of the matter I hold that this appeal is not competent. Now I come to the limitation. The final order having been passed on 23‑4‑1979 and in any case the order dated 8‑12‑1979 concluded the matter once for all. But the appellant still went on making the representations. The appellant still chose not to file an appeal but only to repeat representations, which still not give him fresh cause of action to file an appeal under section 4 of the Service Tribunals Act. This has been clearly held in Government of Pakistan v. Bashir Ahmad Khan's case and I have reproduced the relevant portion while discussing the competency of the appeal. Similarly the case of Shafaat Ahmad and others, as referred to and relevant part of the judgment of Supreme Court as reproduced also directly confirms my views. There is yet another decision of the Supreme Court in case Zia Mohiuddin Khan v. Secretary General Finance and 4 others, reported as 1986 S C M R 782 fully clinches the point under discussion. The relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced as under:‑
  ""This was a second representation and the Tribunal was, therefore, right in not permitting the petitioner to take advantage of it because section 22(2) of Act LXXI of 1973 does not permit a number of representations to be made. We, therefore, agree with the Tribunal that the appeal before it was barred by time and consequently decline to interfere with its order and, therefore, dismiss the petition and decline to grant leave to appeal.""
  23. I, of course, after going through the judgments of Hon'ble S.C. in cases of Bashir Ahmad, Shafaat Ahmad and Zia Mohyuddin Khan and the relevant instructions, find no difficulty to conclude that there is absolutely no scope for second representation for expunction of remarks before the Departmental Authorities. The order passed thereon is, therefore, absolutely void and without jurisdiction.
  24. The other question whether this Tribunal can examine the legality or validity of subsequent orders passed on second representation for expunction of remarks? The orders being void ab initio, without jurisdiction, patently unjust and unlawful, we, therefore, are fully justified to ignore the same instead of perpetuating the illegality by accepting the order as furnishing valid basis for pro forma promotion. We are fortified in our view by the order of the Supreme Court in case of Nawab Syed Raunaq Ali etc. v. C.S.C. and others reported as P L D 1973 S C 236. This decision was followed by their lordships of the Supreme Court in case of Mr. Noor Muhammad v. Member, Election Commission, Punjab, reported as 1985 S C M R 1178. Relevant portion of the judgment reads as under:‑
  ""The learned counsel for the petitioner, however, submitted that the vires of the order, dated 19‑10‑1983 passed by the Departmental authorities in a service matter could not be questioned in collateral proceedings like an appeal before the election authorities.
  This contention too has no force. This Court in Nawab Syed Raunaq Ali etc. v. Chief Settlement Commissioner and others P L D 1973 S C 236 clearly observed:‑
  ""It is now well‑established that where an inferior tribunal or Court has acted wholly without jurisdiction or taken any action ""beyond the sphere allotted to the tribunal by law and, therefore, outside the area within which the law recognises a privilege to err"" then such action amounts to a ""usurpation of power unwarranted by law"" and such an act is a nullity; that is to say, ""the result of a purported exercise of authority which has no legal effect whatsoever"". In such a case, it is well‑established that a superior Court is not bound to give effect to it, particularly where the appeal is to the latter's discretionary jurisdiction. The Courts would refuse to perpetuate, in such circumstances, something which would be patently unjust or unlawful.
  The order of the Superintending Engineer, dated 19‑10‑1983 purporting to give retrospective effect to his order with effect from 29‑7‑1981 was patently unlawful and, in fact, void in the relevant regard. Hence it could not be given effect and the Election Commission could refuse to accept and perpetuate it.""
  25. I, before parting with the judgment, would like to record my observations. The Authority should not have lost sight of the fact that bad precedent spreads like wild fire and completely demolishes the concept of efficient and honest civil servant. No Court can give its blessing to such a precedent which is against law, rules or instructions. It will not be difficult for the aggrieved civil servants to wait even for a decade or so to have in chair authority‑of their own choice to get things done favourably. We have noted that there; is a general tendency to be more obliging towards end of career as civil servant. Such accommodation is shown unmindful of its consequences on the entire service structure and net loss to be sustained by the Exchequer as result thereof. Ours is an Islamic State and we should all bear in mind that we are not only responsible under the E & D Rules to Government but also to the Almighty Allah. They may avoid or escape action by Government for variety of reasons but cannot escape the liability of misdeeds on the Judgment Day. It is difficult to be just and fair in one's dealings with his subordinates inter se and the matters affecting the Government and public until and unless one is mindful of the Dooms Day.
  26. We might have ignored this aspect but the number of cases coming to our notice is so large that we are constrained to bring our observation on record. In one or two cases, the loss suffered by Government amounted to lass of rupees and we were informed that the concerned civil servant had retired years back, whereas action could have been initiated against him under the Rule 1.8 of the Pension Rules within one year of his retirement. The relevant portion of the rule reads as under:‑
  ""Government reserve to themselves the right of recovery from the pension of a Government pensioner on account of losses found in judicial or departmental proceedings to have been caused to Government by the negligence or fraud of such Government pensioner during his service, provided such departmental proceedings shall not be instituted after more than a year from the date of retirement of the Government pensioner. ""
  It is, therefore, desirable to consider amendment of Pension Rules so as to enhance this limit. It is necessary to curb the tendency which is on tremendous increase to oblige some persons at the cost of Exchequer and others.
  27. The result is that both these appeals are allowed and the main. notification dated 24‑8‑1987 is set aside.

    JUDGMENT
  JAVED IQBAL, J.---This petition for leave to appeal is directed against order dated 16-5-2007 whereby writ petition preferred on behalf of petitioner has been dismissed.
  2. Sh. Naveed Shahryar, learned Advocate Supreme Court entered appearance on behalf of petitioner and contended that property in question could not have been declared as `Evacuee Trust Property' by the Chairman, Evacuee Trust Properties Board without any substantial evidence which admittedly is lacking in this case. It is next contended that the property remained in the ownership of Provincial Government in the Revenue Record, hence the exercise of jurisdiction by the Chairman, Evacuee Trust Properties Board under the Evacuee Trust Properties (Management and Disposal) Act, 1975 is illegal. It is also contended that the property in question was directed to be allotted to the petitioner under the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 which could not be done by the Collector for certain extraneous considerations which escaped the notice of learned single Judge in chambers causing serious prejudice against the petitioner.
  3. We have carefully examined the contentions as agitated on behalf of the petitioner in the light of relevant provisions of law and record of the case. We have minutely perused the order impugned. It is worth-mentioning that Anees Ahmad (petitioner) has preferred a writ petition with the following prayer:--
  ""It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that the order dated 8-5-2006 passed by Chairman Evacuee Trust Property (respondent No.2) and the order dated 6-1-2007 passed by the Secretary (respondent No.1) may kindly be declared as unlawful and non-existing as such the writ may kindly be issued.
  Any other relief which this honourable Court deems fit may also be awarded to the petitioners.""
  4. It is to be noted that the property in question has been declared as Evacuee Trust by the Chairman, Evacuee Trust Properties Board, by means of order dated 5-8-2006 and revision petition preferred against it has also been dismissed by the Secretary, Ministry of Minorities and Religious Affairs (Appellate Authority) vide order dated 6-1-2007. The learned Advocate Supreme Court could not point out that as to how the exercise of power by the Chairman, Evacuee Trust Properties Board and Secretary, Ministry of Minorities and Religious Affairs was illegal or ultra vires. We are not persuaded to agree with the prime contention of Sh. Naveed Shahryar, learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner that State land could not have been declared as Evacuee property because no objection worth the name was made by the Provincial Government being a recorded owner. The petitioner has absolutely no cause of grievance because merely the initiation of proceedings qua allotment of the land in question does not amount to factual allotment which was never made in favour of the petitioner. ""The object of proceedings under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan is the enforcement of a right and not the establishment of legal right and therefore the right of the petitioner which he seeks to enforce must be clear and complete and besides that there must be an actual infringement of rights"" (Emphasis provided). In this regard reference can be made to cases titled State of Orissa v. Ram Chandra AUR 1964 SC 685, Dineshcharan v. State of M.B. AIR 1953 Madh. B 165, Kandaswamy v. Deputy Registrar AIR 1954 Mad. 348, Laxman Singh v. Raj Pramukh, M.B. AIR 1953 Madh-B.54.
  5. As mentioned hereinabove the petitioner has no right whatsoever hence the question of its infringement does not arise. The property in question remained 'Dharamsala' in the old record which was subsequently converted into a Primary School for Girls and accordingly its nature was changed and it was recorded as a land to 'Rafah-i-Aamah'. The writ petition preferred on behalf of petitioner is frivolous and misconceived which has rightly been dismissed vide judgment impugned which being well based does not warrant interference. The petition being devoid of merits is dismissed and leave refused.

  JAWWAD S. KHAWAJA, J.--- The petitioner namely Messrs Ahmad Developers impugns the order of the High Court dated 29-5-2008 passed in Constitutional Petition No.D-1645 of 2007. The said order in its entirety reads as under:---
  ""29-5-2008. Mr. Zakir Hussain Khashkhel, Advocate for the petitioner
  Learned counsel for the petitioner states at the bar that the petitioner is awarded the relief as prayed for in the petition and, therefore, the same is no more pressed into service. The petition is disposed of along with the listed applications.""
  2. Constitutional Petition No.1645 of 2007 in which the above order was passed, had been filed by Muhammad Saleh, respondent No.1. Since the said petition was not pressed, the High Court was fully justified in disposing of the same. The subject-matter of the petition was land measuring four acres which was allotted to the respondent, Muhammad Saleh by the Land Utilization Department, Government of Sindh vide order dated 20-9-1994. According to learned counsel for the petitioner, the said respondent had agreed to sell the land to the petitioner vide agreement dated 18-12-1994. The allotment in favour of the respondent was, however, cancelled under the Sindh Government Lands (Cancellation of Allotments, Conversions and Exchanges) Ordinance, 2001. Thereafter, an application was made to the Land Utilization Department for regularization of the aforesaid allotment. This application was also made on behalf of respondent No.1 and we have nothing on record to show that the Land Utilization Department had acknowledged the petitioner as having any rights in the land in dispute.
  3. The case pleaded on behalf of the petitioner can be stated very briefly. According to learned counsel, the respondent No.1 could not have been allowed to withdraw his Constitutional Petition. It appears, this submission is misconceived, for reasons considered below, apart from the fact that the entire case of the petitioner is based on contractual rights allegedly created in its favour under the agreement to sell dated 18-12-1994 referred to above. The fact that the respondent alone was vested with legal rights under the Ordinance mentioned above is acknowledged even in the present petition. This much is evident from the fact that all actions under the said Ordinance were taken in the name of respondent No.1 We further note that the Constitutional Petition was not withdrawn. The impugned order shows that there was no further need to press it, as the relief which was being sought by means of the petition had been allowed by the Sindh Government.
  4. The petitioner has placed reliance on the case titled Javaid Iqbal Abbasi and Co. v. Province of Punjab 1996 SCMR 1433, which we have examined. The cited precedent is clearly distinguishable on facts and the ratio therein is not attracted in the circumstances which have given rise to this case. The most relevant and obvious point of distinction is that the writ petitioner in the precedent case sought unconditional withdrawal of his petition because he was no more interested in getting the relief prayed for. The present C.P.L.A. arises from facts which are contrary to the facts noted in the cited authority. As noted above, the respondent Muhammad Saleh who was the petitioner before the High Court, had been granted relief by the Sindh Government through regularization of the allotment in favour of the said respondent. In the circumstances, it would have been pointless to press the petition any more. The cited precedent, therefore, does not advance the case of the petitioner.
  5. There is another aspect of this case. The contents of the Constitutional Petition filed by respondent No.1 raised serious factual controversies between the petitioner (who was respondent No.8 before the High Court) and respondent No.1 who had filed C.P.No.D-1645 of 2007. Clause (c) of the prayer in the Constitutional Petition is instructive in this behalf. An order was prayed for, inter alia:--
  ""(c) to direct the respondents Nos.1 to 3 and 7 to take the legal action as per law, against the respondent No.8, who has committed the forgery by managed bogus NI Card of the petitioner as well as forged General Power of Attorney to usurp the property of the petitioner.""
  6. In the above circumstances, it is clear that the rights being asserted by the petitioner against respondent No.1 on the basis of the agreement to sell dated 18-12-1994 are contested by respondent No.1. It would be for the petitioner to firstly establish his contractual rights against respondent No.1 and only thereafter could it have a claim against the said respondent for committing breach of the agreement to sell. This contest on the factual plane could only have been determined through a civil suit and not in constitutional jurisdiction, particularly as the Sindh Province was not privy to the said agreement or to any dealings with the petitioner.
  7. We have also noted from the contents of this petition that the petitioner itself has levelled allegations of fraud and misrepresentation against respondent No.1. It has also alleged connivance of ""concerned authorities in disposing/transferring the said land of the petitioner."" We have not found any basis on the record for the said allegations and in particular, the averment as to connivance. Faced with this situation, learned counsel for the petitioner made the extraordinary submission that the petition before the High Court was fictitious. If this indeed is the case, then the petitioner before us would be worse off for want of standing because in such event it would not be possible to hold that a petition was ever filed in the High Court. We do not see how this would help the petitioner.
  8. In view of the foregoing discussion, we find no merit in this petition. The same is, therefore, dismissed and leave to appeal is declined.

    JUDGMENT
  JAVED IQBAL, J.--- Heard Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada. !earned Senior Advocate Supreme Court on behalf of appellant and Mr. Tariq Mehmood, learned Senior Advocate Supreme Court for respondent No.1. We have examined the entire record and perused the judgment of learned trial and appellate Courts vigilantly. After having an in depth scrutiny of the entire record we are of the view that the controversy could not have been set at naught without considering the documentary evidence which escaped the notice of learned trial and appellate Courts and moreso certain important questions having substantial bearing on merits of the case remained unanswered which are as follows:
  (i) How the unnumbered triangular area of about 274.67 square yards was converted into Plot bearing No.D-786 in contravention of the earlier stance of KDA that the open area in question was reserved for further utilization (letters of KDA dated 26-9-1973 and 7-12-1974) and whether it could have been allotted to the appellant or respondent being owner of Plot No. D-279 measuring 600 square yards?
  (ii) How Plot No.D-786 was created by carving out the open area and whether it was in accordance with the prevalent rules, regulations and policy of KDA?
  (iii) Whether KDA has any authority to allot the open area to appellant by converting it into Plot No.D-786 which could not have been leased out as per the laws of KDA i.e. Regulation No.6 read with Regulation No.23 which deals with the question of allotment and annexation of adjacent land?
  (iv) Whether Chief Minister, Sindh was competent to make such allotment in favour of Saleem Wafai (respondent No.3) who had initially requested for allotment of a plot measuring 274 square yards which was subsequently converted into 384.33 square yards by KDA presumably on the direction of the then Chief Minister, Sindh but such plot could not have been carved out from the open area as independent in terms of the scheme?
  (v) Whether the statutory notice would be mandatory in case the act of competent authority is prima facie i.e. illegal and ultra vires with mala fide intention?
  (vi) Whether any resolution was passed by the governing body prior to such allotment?
  (vii) Whether issuance of statutory notice under Article 131 of the KDA Order in Suit No.1017 of 1980 copy whereof was filed with the plaint but went unnoticed can be considered sufficient in subsequent suits?
  (viii) Whether any allotment could have been made in favour of Mst. Bilquis Qadri (appellant) through intervention of the Courts specially when a plot of 600 square yards was also in her possession and Plot bearing No.D-786 was more than 50% of the area which could not have been allotted in absence of any vested or legal rights?
  (ix) Whether Mst. Bilquis Qadri (appellant) is a bona fide purchaser and her rights and interest are protected under section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882?
  (x) Whether documentary evidence has been appreciated properly which is indicative of the fact that initially the open are was about 274.33 square yards then how it was enhanced to that of 384.33 square yards and allotted to Saleem Wafai (respondent No.3)?
  (xi) What would be the impact of provisions as enumerated in section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 being substantive in nature and statutory law vis-a-vis Disposal of Lands and Estate Rules and Regulations of KDA?
  (xii) Whether Mst. Bilquis Qadri (appellant) can be considered as a lawful owner of Plot bearing No.D-786 measuring 384.33 square yards in KDA Scheme No.1-A (Extension) as bona fide purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration without notice of any claim of any party in terms of registered Deed of Conveyance/Sale-deed dated 17-9-1979 and mutation dated 3-6-1982?
  (xiii) Whether the provisions as enumerated under Rule 15 of the KDA (Disposal of Land) Rules, 1971 authorize the Chief Minister to relax the provision of any clause and direct the KDA for allotment of the plot in question i.e. D-786?
  (xiv) Whether the allotment in favour of Saleem Wafai (respondent No.3) stood regularized upon lease having been subsequently granted by KDA for 99 years in favour of Mst. Bilquis Qadri (appellant) vide lease deed dated 30-8-1977 upon her having purchased the said plot from Nazeerul Hassan by whom it was purchased from Saleem Wafai (respondent No.3)?
  2. In the light of what has been stated above, the judgment impugned is set aside and case remanded to learned trial Court for deciding afresh after affording proper opportunity of hearing to all concerned. The contentions raised before this Court can be agitated before learned trial Court which shall be decided without being influenced from any previous order made in the case. The above mentioned questions should be dilated upon and decided in accordance with law and on merits. The learned trial Court may frame additional issues and record evidence if need be in order to resolve the dispute completely. The appeal is disposed of in above terms.

    JUDGMENT
  MIAN HAMID FAROOQ, J.---Sahib Dad, the petitioner, seeks leave to appeal against order, dated 3-7-2001, whereby the learned Lahore High Court at Lahore dismissed his application filed under section 12(2) read with section 151, C.P.C. (Civil Miscellaneous No.410/C of 2001 in Civil Revision No.1130-D of 1989).
  2. Abdul Ghafoor (respondent No.2) was allotted State land measuring 65 Kanals, 10 Marlas in Chak No.96/NB, Tehsil and District Sargodha, he, statedly, fulfilled all the conditions of allotment and proprietary rights qua the land were, reportedly, conferred on him. He apprehending resumption of the State land by the Provincial Government, on 19-7-1984, filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the Provincial Government from resumption of land. During pendency of the said suit, Abdul Ghafoor, agreed to sell the questioned land, vide agreement to sell dated 10-8-1986 for a consideration of Rs.4,50,000, to the petitioner; said Abdul Ghafoor did not abide by the terms of the agreement to sell and thereupon the petitioner filed a suit for specific performance against Abdul Ghafoor, which was decreed by the learned trial Court, vide judgment and decree, dated 21-3-1995 and two appeals (R.F.A. No.133 of 1995 and R.F.A. No.33 of 1996), filed by both the parties, were dismissed by the learned Division Bench of Lahore High Court, vide judgment and decree dated 10-11-1998. Aforementioned suit filed by Abdul Ghafoor against Provincial Government was decreed in his favour by the trial Court on 23-11-1987 and appeal filed by the Provincial Government was dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, Sargodha on 11-7-1988, however, the learned Lahore High Court at Lahore accepted the revision petition (Civil Revision No.1130 of 1989), filed by the Provincial Government, vide judgment dated 6-12-2000 and the suit was dismissed on the ground that Abdul Ghafoor had already been allotted land in another Chak which he was retaining, therefore, he could not be given land in dispute and the Provincial Government was justified in law to resume this land. The petitioner, on 16-6-2001, filed an application under section 12(2) read with section 151, C.P.C. (Civil Miscellaneous No.410/C of 2001) for setting aside judgment, dated, 6-12-2000, passed by the learned revisional Court favouring respondent No.1, but without any success as the learned Lahore High Court dismissed the said application, vide impugned order, dated 3-7-2001, hence the present petition.
  3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that petitioner being a transferee pendente lite was a necessary party in the revision petition and although the Provincial Government was aware that the petitioner's name was recorded as owner in the Revenue Record yet it did not file any application before the revisional Court for impleading the petitioner in the revision petition. He further submitted that petitioner's application under section 12(2), C.P.C. under the circumstances was competent and it was wrongly dismissed. He has relied upon the cases reported as Surraya Begum v. Suban Begum 1992 SCMR 652, Rashid Ahmed v. Jiwan 1997 SCMR 170 and Muhammad Nawaz Khan v. Muhammad Khan 2002 SCMR 2003. On the other hand, learned Law Officer has submitted that the decree passed against an assignor is binding on the assignee; that the application under section 12(2), C.P.C. was not maintainable and that in view of section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 the petitioner was neither necessary nor proper party to the proceedings. He has referred to Shamsher Ali v. Sher Ali PLD 1976 Lah. 650.
  4. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned Law officer and examined the available record. Abdul Ghafoor filed the suit against the Provincial Government on 19-7-1984, it was decreed on 23-11-1987, the first appeal was dismissed on 11-7-1988 and the revision petition was allowed on 6-12-2000, while the basis of the claim of the petitioner i.e. agreement to sell is dated 10-8-1986. Thus, the petitioner agreed to purchase the disputed land, vide agreement to sell dated 10-8-1986 when suit titled Abdul Ghafoor v. Province of Punjab and others was pending. It flows therefrom that the proceedings qua the petitioner, which took off from the date of agreement to sell dated 10-8-1986 and ended with the attestation of mutation i.e. on 9-5-1995, were undertaken during pendency of the suit, appeal and revision arising out of the suit titled ""Abdul Ghafoor v. Province of Punjab and others"", thus, undoubtedly the petitioner was a transferee pendente lite. Additionally, it has been admitted in the present petition and acknowledged by learned counsel that the status of the petitioner is that of transferee pendente lite. According to the petitioner, Abdul Ghafoor during the pendency of the suit assigned his rights in the disputed land in his favour. In the said scenario the case of the petitioner was adequately covered under the provisions of Order XXII, rule 10(1), C.P.C., but he did not choose to file any such application and felt satisfied on defending the proceedings by Abdul Ghafoor. Learned counsel has although relied upon the judgment of Surraya Begum (ibid), yet the in-depth perusal amply shows that it does not help the petitioner. It has been held in the said case that assignee may file an application to either become a party under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. or for his substitution in place of the assignor and if the assignee chooses not to file any application for his impleadment in the proceedings then the decision against the assignor would be binding upon him. It appears appropriate to reproduce the relevant portion of the judgment, which reads as under:--
  ""The assignee need not bring himself on record, if he feels that his interest is being protected by his assignor, in which case the decision for or against his assignor would be binding upon him. See Luxmi Narayan's case (supra) and Nawabzada Shamsher Ali Khan v. Maj. Gen. Nawabzada Sher Ali Khan PLD 1976 Lah. 650. The suit in such a case would be treated as continuing for the benefit of the assignee, who can, after the decree is passed, file execution proceedings, see Uchhab Pratta v. Brundaban Malik AIR 1969 Orissa 142 and Jugalkishara Saraf v. Raw Cotton Co. Ltd. AIR 1955 SC 376. It is only when the assignee feels that his interest is in jeopardy and not likely to be protected by the assignor, that he can apply to become either a party under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. See Ameer Muhammad v. Jiwanlal AIR 1952 MB 154, or to be substituted, for his assignor under Order XXII, rule 10, C.P.C. In the former case, the decree for or against the assignor would be binding on the assignee, and the assignee would be deemed fully represented through the decree-holder. See Banke Behari Lal v. Ranghubar Dayal AIR 1930 All. 380 and in the latter case the decree would be treated as one for or against the assignee, as .transferee of the assignor. In both cases, the decree covers, the first directly and the second impliedly.""
  Admittedly, the petitioner opted not to become a party in the proceedings and he did not file any application for his impleadment or substitution. In the said eventuality any order, judgment or decree passed against the assignor is binding on the assignee as per the principle laid down by this Court in the case of Surrya Begum (ibid).
  5. There is yet another aspect of the case. The petitioner did not challenge order, dated 6-12-2000, whereby revision petition filed by Provincial Government against Abdul Ghafoor was allowed. It is true that the petitioner was not a party to the said revision petition, but it is equally true that he, under the law, could have challenged the said order. It has been held in the case of H.M. Saya & Co. v. Wazir Ali Industries Limited PLD 1969 SC 65 that a stranger to a suit or a proceeding can file an appeal if he adversely affected by an order in that suit or proceeding.
  6. Now coming to the judgments referred to by the learned counsel. As regards the case of Rashid Ahmed (ibid), suffice it to say that in the said case the question involved was as to whether the transferee pendente lite in view of section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is debarred from being made party to the pending proceedings. In the case in hand the said question is not in issue, as the petitioner did not file any application either under Order I, rule 10, C.P.C. or Order XXII, rule 10, C.P.C. As regards the case of Muhammad Nawaz Khan (ibid), it primarily deals with the rights of a bona fide purchaser for value during the pendency of proceedings. We asked the learned counsel to show, with the reference to his application under section 12(2), C.P.C., as to whether the petitioner ever pleaded that he is a bona fide purchaser for consideration. He after examining the said application categorically admitted before us that no such plea was raised. In view whereof, the said judgments are also, of no avail to the petitioner.
  7. In the above perspective, we have examined the impugned order and find that it does not suffer from any legal infirmity and it was passed not only in accordance with the record of the case but also in consonance with the law on the subject. We are not persuaded to reverse the said order.
  8. For the foregoing reasons, the present petition, being devoid of merits, stands dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.

    JUDGMENT
  MIAN SHAKIRULLAH JAN, J.---This petition is directed against the judgment and decree of the Lahore High Court, Lahore, whereby Civil Revision filed by the petitioners against the judgment and decree of the two Courts below was dismissed.
  2. The background of the case is that respondent No.1 Nazir Ahmed filed a suit for declaration with consequential relief of permanent injunction claiming ownership of the land being a transferee from the original allottee to whom the land was allotted vide Mutation No.836, dated 6-11-1990, challenging order, dated 30-8-1994 passed by the Board of Revenue petitioner No.2 whereby allotment of the original allottee was cancelled to be declared against law void and illegal and ineffective on his rights. According to the plaint, one Talib Hussain Shah predecessor-in-interest of respondents Nos.2 to 4 was allotted a piece of land in Toba Tek Singh, District under Grow More Scheme in the year 1956 which was made by him cultivable. This land was resumed however, under another scheme to accommodate such-like affectees, the allottee was allotted some other land. The allottee after fulfilling the requisite formalities i.e. the payment of price etc. registered sale-deed No.859 was executed and registered in favour of the successors of the allottee on 9-9-1990 as the original allottee died in the meanwhile and the Mutation No.833 was sanctioned on 12-9-1990. This land was sold to Mst. Niaz Bibi vide Mutation No.834, dated 2-10-1990 who onward transferred it in favour of respondent No. 1/plaintiff through exchange Mutation No.711 dated 27-10-1990. The Board of Revenue proceeded to cancel the allotment order purportedly after issuance of notice to the original allottee on 23-8-1994, but without notice to the subsequent vendee including the plaintiffs by exercising its jurisdiction under section 16 of the Punjab Colonization of Government Lands Act, 1912. The plaintiffs/respondents being aggrieved of the cancellation order filed the instant suit which was contested by the petitioners/defendants as a result of which issues were framed and evidence was recorded and ultimately his suit was decreed with a similar result before the Appellate Court and also the Revisional Court. Against which now the present petition has been filed.
  3. We have gone through the impugned judgment and also available relevant record. According to the impugned judgment, the respondent was condemned unheard as no notice has been issued to him despite the fact that after allotment of the property to the original allottee, it was transferred to him through a valid legal process with its subsequent entry in the Revenue Record in his name and was also in possession of the property. The notice statedly to have been issued to the original allottee was also found not to be supported from the record. The powers with regard to the cancellation under sections 16 and 30(2) of the Act can be exercised only in case of tenancy and not in case of permanent allotment as in the instant case and moreso, with a prerequisite condition of fraud and misrepresentation and the impugned order was held as without jurisdiction by further observing that if the petitioners felt aggrieved of the allotment order, the remedy for them was to be filed a civil suit and not in the manner in which they have proceeded. The objection of the department with regard to the notification qua the allotment of the land within the prohibitory zone of two miles of Municipal Limits was also properly attended to through the impugned judgment and it was held that once the land was made available for allotment and it was transferred and settled on the allottee, then it would supersede the notification imposing such prohibition. At the end the High Court while concurring with the judgment of the two Courts below have held that there is no misreading or non-reading of evidence to justify interference in the judgments of the Courts below.
  4. Since all the points raised before the High Court found properly attended to and met reasonably and we see no flaw in the impugned judgment to justify interference. Consequently, we see no force in this petition and the same is dismissed.

    JUDGMENT
  FAQIR MUHAMMAD KHOKHAR, J.--- The respondents Nos.1 to 3 instituted a suit for declaration with permanent injunction in that they were the allottees of the suit-land measuring 88 Kanals and 2 Marlas situate at Chak No.14-RB, Tehsil Safdarabad, District Sheikhupura, under the scheme known as one Killa per Person and that the allotment and sale of the same in favour of the appellants or their father late Misri was void ab initio and that the appellants were required to be restrained from interfering with its possession. Their suit was dismissed by the Civil Judge, Sheikhupura, vide judgment, dated 22-3-2005 which was affirmed by the Additional District Judge, Sheikhupura, vide judgment, dated 27-6-2005. Therefore, they filed Civil Revision No.1972 of 2005, which was allowed by a learned single Judge of the Lahore High Court, Lahore, vide impugned judgment, dated 24-10-2005 and the suit was partly decreed in their favour to the extent of possession of the suit-land.
  2. The learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the entitlement certificate of the allotment of land had been duly issued by the Commissioner, Mangla Dam Affairs, Mirpur (AJ&K) in favour of late Misri predecessor-in-interest of the appellants who was allotted the suit-land, vide allotment Chit No.26, dated 8-3-1976. After deposit of the Government dues Mutation No.1535 was attested on the basis of the sale-deed which was got registered by the Collector on 15-1-2002. Entries of the conferment of proprietary rights were also reflected in the Revenue Record of rights.
  3. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents argued that the allotment and the grant of proprietary rights of the suit-land in favour of the appellants by the Collector were fake and fraudulent and that they were not entitled to the same. Our attention was drawn to letter, dated 8-3-1976, issued by the Commissioner, Mangla Dam Affairs, Mirpur (AJ&K) to the Deputy Commissioner, Sheikhupura in which it was stated that the allotment of the land in Chak No.25-UC Tehsil Ferozewala, District Sheikhupura, was cancelled from the name of earlier allottee Imam Din and that the entitlement certificate in favour of late Misri, predecessor-in-interest of the appellants had been issued and enclosed who was entitled to allotment of alternate land in colony area of Punjab.
  4. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and have also perused the available record. We find that on the basis of the entitlement certificate and Allotment Chit No.26 the Collector, Sheikhupura had got registered sale-deed, dated 15-1-2002 in favour of the appellants followed by Mutation No.1535. The Register Haqdaran Zamin also showed that the suit-land stood transferred in the name of the appellants. None of the Courts had found the entitlement of the contesting respondents to the suit-land as claimed by them. Therefore, the High Court was not justified in partly decreeing the suit of the respondents as regards their possession over the same. The High Court could not ignore the evidence which clearly indicated the transfer/sale of the suit-land and grant of its proprietary rights on the appellants being affectees of Mangla dam. The impugned judgment of the High Court suffers from misreading and non-reading of material evidence on record and the same is not sustainable at law.
  5. For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment, dated 24-10-2005 of the High Court is set aside. Consequently, the suit of the respondents shall stand dismissed throughout. No order as to costs.

    JUDGMENT
  MUHAMMAD NAWAZ ABBASI, J.---This appeal, by leave of the Court; has been directed against the judgment dated 24-7-1998 passed by Lahore High Court, Lahore, whereby Writ Petition bearing No.154-R of 1985, filed by the appellant, involving the dispute of land was dismissed. Despite service, no one appeared on behalf of the respondent, therefore, they are proceeded against ex parte.
  2. The facts of the case, in small compass, are that in 1963, land measuring 3 Kanals, 1 Marlas which also included land measuring 1 Kanal and 6 Marlas bearing Khasra No. 281/72-73 Khata No.11 of the Register RL-II, Sialkot was proposed for allotment in the name of respondent Nos.3 and 4 and Fard Taqseem was accordingly issued to them on 3-1-1963 and 3-10-1963 which was confirmed in their name vide order dated 26-5-1965. The allottees thereafter sold the land measuring 1 Kanal, 6 Marlas to the appellant vide registered sale-deed dated 30-4-1964 with possession and she constructed two rooms at the site. However, Ali Hussain by way of filing an appeal challenged the order of confirmation of land without impleading the appellant as party. The appellate authority allowed the appeal in which case was remanded to the Settlement Officer and on dismissal of revision filed by the appellant against the remand order as time-barred vide order dated 21-8-1976, she filed a Writ Petition No. 1905-R/76 which was allowed by the High Court vide order dated 1-6-1981 in which direction was given to the revisional authority for decision of revision afresh. Meanwhile original allottees i.e. respondents Nos.3 and 4, having withdrawn their claim of produce index units from the district in which the land was allotted to them, got the same transferred in another district. The Settlement authorities, treating the disputed land measuring 1 Kanals, 6 Marlas available in the joint Khata allotted 17 Marlas of land to respondent No.2 on 24-6-1974/10-5-1973 without partition. The appellant filed a revision petition against the order of allotment of land in favour of respondent No.2 which was dismissed by Additional Commissioner (Rev) exercising the powers of Settlement Commissioner, Gujranwala, vide order dated 20-4-1985. The appellant being aggrieved of the above order, filed a writ petition in the Lahore High Court and on dismissal of the same, she preferred a C.P.L.A. before this Court in which leave was granted vide order dated 4-12-2002 as under:-
  ""3. It is, inter alia, contended;
  (a) that in appeal before the Additional Settlement Commissioner which was decided on 20-5-1965, the petitioner was not made party, therefore, she was condemned unheard;
  (b) that the petitioner had purchased the land from the allottee whose claim was never held to be in genuine through sale-deed as far back as 30-4-1964 therefore, the said allottee could not have got his units transferred to some other village to deprive the petitioner of her valuable right as owner thereof, though it was possible may be in case of cancellation of the allotment of the allottee on the ground of fraud in obtaining the allotment in excess of verified claim or no claim, therefore, the petitioner could not have been deprived of the land purchased by her before the allotment after confirmation of the same in favour of Muhammad Shafi and he could not in such a case get the units transferred and even if the units were transferred to some other village, the allotment in that village should have been cancelled instead of depriving the petitioner of her valuable rights who had purchased the same with valuable consideration without notice bonafidly.
  4. Leave is granted to consider inter alia the above contentions. Till the disposal of the appeal, possession of the petitioner over the land in dispute shall not be disturbed or interfered with.""
  3. Mr. Shahzad Shaukat, learned Advocate Supreme Court, counsel for the appellant has contended that the appeal filed by Ali Hussain and Muhammad Iqbal (locals) was time-barred and was liable to be dismissed alone on the above ground. The learned counsel submitted that order of cancellation of allotment of respondents Nos.3 and 4 by the Additional Settlement Commissioner was without lawful authority and further the order passed by the revisional authority was not in accordance with the judgment of High Court dated 1-6-1981 passed in Writ Petition No.1905-R of 1976.
  4. Having heard the learned counsel for the appellant perused the record with his assistance, we have found that revisional order was not based on sound principles as the revisional authority without considering the material available on record in proper manner passed the order and the legal defect in the order escaped the notice of the High Court. The Settlement Commissioner, in the post remand proceedings, without giving due consideration to the points raised before him rejected the revision petition in a perfunctory manner and similarly, the observation of the High Court that the question relating to the validity of the order passed by the appellate authority in appeal decided in the earlier round attained finality by virtue of the judgment dated 1-4-1981 passed by the High Court in Writ Petition No.1905-R/76, filed by the appellant, was the result of misreading of true facts on record. This may be pointed out that in their earlier round of litigation writ petition was accepted by the High Court whereby the order of the Settlement Commissioner was set aside and case was remanded for decision afresh of the revision petition in which appellant had challenged the order dated 26-5-1965 and consequently, the contention of learned counsel for the appellant that in the facts of the present case in the background, section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882; would come to the rescue of the purchaser has sufficient force and no exception could be taken to the judgment of the High Court in the earlier round of litigation wherein it was held that order dated 21-8-1976 passed by the Settlement Commissioner (Lands) was without lawful authority. In consequence thereto, notwithstanding the withdrawal of units from the District of original allotment, the right of ownership already accrued in favour of appellant could not be disturbed through the device of transfer of units and since the subsequent order of allotment passed by the settlement authorities was without lawful authority to the extent of land owned by the appellant, therefore, would have no effect on her right, title and interest in the land subject-matter of the dispute. These are the reasons for our short order of even date, which is read as under:--
  ""For the reasons to be record later, this appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment dated 24-7-1998 passed by the Lahore High Court, Lahore is set aside and in consequence thereto, the appellant is declared to be lawful owner of the property.""
  5. This appeal is accordingly allowed with no order as to the costs.

    JUDGMENT
  MUHAMMAD NAWAZ ABBASI, J.---This appeal, by leave of the Court, has been directed against the judgment dated 58-10-1996 passed by Lahore High Court, Lahore, whereby the learned Judge in Chambers while dismissing the Writ Petition bearing No.4430 of 1996 filed by appellants, directed the Deputy Land Commissioner for conclusion of the inquiry in terms of the order dated 19-10-1995 passed by Senior Member, Federal Land Commissioner within three months.
  2. The facts of the case, in small compass, leading to the filing of instant appeal are that Syed Muhammad Tahir Shah, a landowner of Tehsil Chiniot District Jhang by filing declaration under MLR 64 (West Pakistan Land Reforms Regulations, 1959) surrendered land measuring 521 Kanals, 15 Marlas in village Sadev of Tehsil Chiniot, District Jhang. The present appellants claiming themselves in cultivating possession of the land before the promulgation of MLR 64, asserted for allotment of the resumed land as tenants of Syed M. Tahir Shah, declarant whereas Muhammad Yar and Ahmed Yar sons of Muhammad Hayat, respondents Nos.3 and 4, in this appeal and other residents of village Bhukharian set up their title in the land measuring 434 Kanals, 15 Marlas on the basis of mutations sanctioned in their names on different dates. It was stated that these respondents managed to procure a forged order dated 30-3-1980 allegedly passed by Tehsildat, Chiniot exercising the power of Sub-Assistant Land Commissioner (SALC) wherein they claimed ownership of the land as auction-purchaser and consequently, they got a fake and bogus mutation sanctioned in their favour. The appellants challenging the genuineness of the claim of respondents, filed a direct revision before the Additional Chief Land Commissioner, Punjab, which was dismissed vide order dated 13-4-1983 and thereafter, they filed a second revisions before the Federal Land Commission, Government of Pakistan, which succeeded and Mr. Amir Yousaf Ali Khan, Member, Federal Land Commission, while setting aside the order of the Additional Chief Land Commissioner, Punjab, remanded the case to the Deputy Land Commissioner, Jhang for a thorough enquiry into the matter. The respondent Nos. 3 and 4 filed a Writ Petition No. 5401 of 1983 in the Lahore High Court against the order of Federal Land Commission, which was dismissed and the order of High Court having been not further challenged, attained finality. The Deputy Land Commissioner, Jhang, having found the Mutation Nos. 480, 484, 485, 486-490 and 471, 472, 476 and 477, sanctioned on different dates, based on forged order, directed for registration of criminal case against the respondent Nos. 3 and 4, as beneficiary of the transaction together with Akhtar Raza Zaidi, Reader to SALC/Tehsildar, Chiniot, and Ghulam Hussain, Consolidation Patwari, who were found responsible for committing fraud and forgery. Deputy Land Commissioner therefore, directed the SALC to determine the eligibility of tenants of the resumed land and submit the list of eligible persons. In the process, Muhammad Yar, respondents, made a statement before Colony Assistant that he was owner of 38 Kanals of land in village Sadev and was in self-cultivating possession of this land since 1970. The SALC having formed an opinion that respondents Nos.2 and 3 were not entitled to the allotment of resumed land determined the eligibility of 21 persons including the appellant and submitted the list of eligible persons accordingly. The conclusion drawn by the Deputy Land Commissioner, Jhang was affirmed by Mr. Shahzed Hassan Pervez, Land Commissioner, Faisalabad, in appeal filed by the respondents who after hearing the parties, held that on repeal of MLR 64, the land resumed thereunder was available for disposal under MLR 115 and disposed of the appeal in terms of para. 32(4) of Land Reforms Regulation, 1972. The respondents namely Ahmed Yar and Muhammad Yar and one Bahawal son of Sadad filed separate revision against the above order and Chief Land Commissioner, Punjab, disposed of the revisions with the observation that the conclusion drawn by the Deputy Land Commissioner to the effect that respondent Nos.3 and 4 were not eligible for grant of resumed land in village Sadev, Tehsil Chiniot, District Jhang, under para. 18(3) of the Land Reforms Regulation, 1972 (Martial Law Regulation No.115 of 1972) as they were owners of more than five acres of land in the village was unexceptional. The revision was accordingly dismissed vide order dated 9-6-1993 and respondents then filed a revision petition against the above order before the Federal Land Commission, Pakistan, which came up for hearing before Mr. M. Ashiq Siddiqui, Senior Member, Federal Land Commission, Islamabad (Camp at Lahore) who allowed the revision and remanded the case to Deputy Land Commissioner for decision afresh. The appellants being aggrieved of the order of Senior Member, Federal Land Commission, filed a writ petition in the Lahore High Court, Lahore (Writ Petition No.4430 of 1996), which was dismissed in limine vide impugned judgment with the observation as under:
  Sikander and three others challenged the order dated 19-10-1995, of the Senior Member, Federal Land Commission by invoking the constitutional jurisdiction with the pleas that the petitioners are admittedly found entitled to get the allotment of land as tenants of the resumed land as tenants of the resumed land and, therefore, entry which has been ordered to be held in the impugned order should not have been made basis for allotment in their favour. On enquiry, learned counsel frankly stated that if ineligible persons who are twenty one in number after the enquiry are held to be eligible then the right to the allotment of the land will be adversely affected. This being the position, the allotment to the determination of all the eligible tenants entitled to receive the allotment of the resumed land. We are also told that a civil revision (C. No.3017/94) pertaining to a part of land in dispute is pending adjudication and the final determination cannot take place unless the said revision petition is not decided.
  The remand orders are ordinarily not interfered with in constitutional jurisdiction specially when the decision so made by the competent authority by remanding the order is not challenged and controverted. It is true that the matter of allotment is pending for the last two decades but without consideration of the question of eligibility grant of allotments cannot take place. In the circumstances, no justifiable exception can be taken to the impugned order of the learned Senior Member Federal Land Commission and interference in exercise of extra-ordinary constitutional jurisdiction is not warranted. We will, however, directed the Deputy Land Commission to whom the case is remanded to conclude the enquiry within three months. The office is also directed to put up the file of Cr. No.3017 of 1994 before the Chief Justice for fixation of the same for disposal. The writ petition is without merit and is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs.""
  3. The appellant have filed the instant appeal in which leave was granted vide order dated 12-4-1999, as under:--
  ""3. We are inclined to grant leave to consider the following questions:
  (i) whether factually the appellants entitlement to the disputed land has been determined;
  (ii) if the answer of the above question is in the affirmative, whether the learned Senior Member, Federal Land Commission by his order dated 19-10-1995 was justified in remaining the case; and
  (iii) whether the learned Division Bench was justified to maintain the above order. Leave to appeal is accordingly granted.""
  4. Learned counsel for the appellants contended that FLC on the basis of wrong assumption of law and facts, remanded the case of the DLC and High Court without properly appreciating the matter in true prospect, passed the impugned judgment through misreading of the record. Learned counsel submitted that the judgment rendered by the High Court in a slipshod manner, was suffering from serious infirmity of patent errors on record which caused miscarriage of justice as the order dated 19-10-1995 passed by Senior Member, Federal Land Commission, was suffering from legal defect of misappreciating the correct legal and factual position, which has caused serious prejudice to the appellants as after determination of their eligibility as genuine claimants, there was no justification for remand of case and in any case except the appellants, there was no other genuine claimant. Learned counsel asserted that since the right of the appellant for allotment of resumed land, was established on record, therefore, the High Court was under legal obligation to dispose of the writ petition on merits and not to maintain the remand order.
  5. Learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand has vehemently contended that the learned High Court has rightly dismissed the writ petition and this Court may not interfere in the conclusion arrived at by the High Court on a question of fact.
  6. The observation of the High Court regarding interference in remand order in writ petition particularly in a case which involves factual inquiry is correct but at the same time, this is settled principle that in a case in which facts are not as such disputed, the High Court may pass appropriate order on merit in respect of legal rights of the parties involved therein in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction and should not remand the case to a lower forum which may not serve any purpose except to prolong the litigation. In the present case, we find that basic facts were admitted and the High Court instead of remanding the case of the Land Commission Authorities could conveniently decide the question of entitlement of the parties on the basis of the facts available on record. The Deputy Land Commission after remand of the case by the Federal Land Commission having conducted a through inquiry prepared the list of eligible persons and passed order accordingly, therefore, subject to all just exceptions apparently no further enquiry was required to be conducted. The judgment rendered by the High Court in a slipshod manner without appreciating the legal and factual aspect of the case in the light of material available on record and determining the rights of allotment of resumed land, was not correct exercise of the jurisdiction.
  7. In the light of the facts and circumstances of the case in the background, the High Court was required to determine the question of eligibility of the parties in letter and spirit and instead of remanding the case back to the Land Commission Authorities should have passed an appropriate order on merits on the basis of available record.
  8. In consequence to the foregoing discussion, we allow this appeal, set aside the impugned judgment and remand the case to the High Court for decision of the writ petition on merits afresh in accordance with law. There shall be no order as to costs.

    ORDER
  RANA BHAGWANDAS, J.---This petition is directed against Sindh High Court judgment, dated 2-6-2006 dismissing petitioner's writ petition seeking direction to respondents Nos.2 and 3 to allot the plot of land to him within the city of Karachi as ordered by the Chief Minister, Sindh; on the application of the petitioner way back on 10-2-1986. The ground which weighed with the High Court appears to be that Chief Minister, Sindh was not legally authorized and competent to allot any plot of land in urban areas without formulation of any scheme under the Sindh Local Government Ordinance, 1979. At any rate he could not act at his whims as the procedure prescribed for regulating the transfer of land in City of Karachi was neither followed nor adhered to. While referring to an earlier judgment of Sindh High Court in Abdul Haq v. Government of Sindh PLD 2000 Kar. 224, the High Court observed that all public functionaries howsoever high they may be are bound to act within the parameters of law.
  2. We have heard Mr. Akhlaq Ahmad Siddiqui, learned Advocate -on-Record for the petitioner at some length and gone through the record as well as the impugned judgment of the High Court.
  3. We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the Division Bench of the High Court when it says that public functionaries including the Chief Minister can deal with the public property only under a prescribed procedure within the parameters of law under a duly sanctioned scheme and not at their whims. Even if such order was passed by the Chief Minister in favour of the petitioner, authorities concerned would not be bound to follow such illegal and void order of a superior authority. It would rather be in the exigencies of good order of administration and their duty to point out to the high-ups that they were acting in excess of their lawful authority and in violation of law and the constitutional mandate. They may be apprised of the legal consequences flowing from such acts. The compliance of any illegal and arbitrary order is neither binding on the subordinate forums nor valid in the eyes of law. Reference in this behalf may be made to decision of this Court in Abdul Haq Indhar V. Province of Sindh 2000 SCMR 907 and (ii) Taj Muhammad v. Town Committee 1994 CLC 2214.
  4. In view of what has been stated above, we are of the view that the High Court neither committed any illegality nor acted in violation of settled principles of law while dismissing the petitioner's writ petition. Impugned judgment thus, does not call for interference.
  5. Resultantly, this petition fails and is dismissed being without any merit.

    ORDER
  MUHAMMAD AKHTAR SHABBIR, J.--- The petitioner seeks leave to appeal against the order, dated 2-4-2007 passed by a learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court, in Writ Petition No.526 of 2006.
  2. The brief facts giving rise to the present petition are to the effect that Nawab Khan son of Taj Muhammad, predecessor-in-interest, of respondent No.2 Muhammad Rafique had filed a ""Mukhbari"" application on 8-9-1963, for cancellation of the land confirmed against claim Form No.17953 at RL-II No.3/10 of Mauza Jhakar Imam Shah. An enquiry was conducted and the application filed by Nawab Khan was found correct and on 11-5-1974, it was directed that the cancelled land be allotted in his name against his verified claim. This order was challenged through a revision petition before the Additional Settlement Commissioner, Multan Division, Multan with powers of Chief Settlement Commissioner and the revision filed by Mst. Manati was dismissed. The proceedings were pending when the Evacuee property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975, was enforced. The allotment was not made in favour of Nawab Khan. Resultantly on 30-1-2004, the Notified Officer passed an order and allotted the land in favour of L.Rs. of Nawab Khan. The said order has been challenged by the petitioners through a Writ Petition No.5261 of 2006 in the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, Multan, which was dismissed by a learned Single Judge in Chambers of the Lahore High Court, vide the impugned order dated 2-4-2007, out of which the present petition for leave to appeal, has arisen.
  3. The learned counsel. for the petitioner contended that it was not a pending case under the Settlement Laws and the land could not be allotted to respondent No.2, who had further made transaction in favour of respondents Nos.3 and 4. Further contended that after the enforcement of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975, the petitioner was in occupation of the land as tenant of the Government and in view of subsection (1), clause (b) of section 3, the petitioner is entitled for purchase of the land. Further contended that the order impugned in the writ petition was a void order and the principle of ""laches"" is not attracted to that case. In support of his arguments, he placed reliance on the cases of Ali Muhammad through L.Rs. and others v. Chief Settlement Commissioner 2001 SCMR 1822 and Ahmed and 25 others v. Ghama and 5 others 2005 SCMR 119.
  4. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the record with his kind assistance.
  5. It is admitted position that Nawab Khan, father of respondent No.1, had filed a ""Mukhbari"" application under sections 10 and 11 of the Displaced Persons Land (Settlement) Act, 1958, for cancellation of the land allotted at RL-II No.3/10 of Mauza Jhakar Imam Shah, quite in time. Before the enforcement of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975, the Settlement Authorities on his ""Mukbari"" application cancelled the land and directed allotment of the said land in favour of Nawab Khan, against his verified claim. But the matter could not be completed till the enforcement of the said Act. Section 3 of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975, deals with transfer of property. The relevant provisions of the section are reproduced as under:-
  ""3. Transfer of property.---All properties, both urban and rural, including agricultural land, other than such properties attached to charitable, religious or educational trusts or institutions, whether occupied or unoccupied, which may be available for disposal immediately before the repeal of the aforesaid Acts and Regulations, or which may become available for disposal after such repeal as a result of a final order passed under subsection (3) of section 2, shall stand transferred to the Provincial Government on payment of such price as may be fixed by the Federal Government in consultation with the Provincial Government, for disposal---
  (a) in the case of urban properties, by the Provincial Government under a scheme to be prepared by it in this behalf; and
  (b) in the case of rural properties, by the Board of Revenue of the Province under a scheme to be prepared by the Provincial Government in this behalf:
  Provided that agricultural land occupied by any person continuously for four harvests immediately preceding Kharif, 1973 shall first be offered for sale to such person unless an order of ejectment has been passed against him in respect of such land:
  Provided further that only so much land shall be offered to such person as does not together with land already held by him, exceed a subsistence holding within the meaning of the Land Reforms Regulations, 1972.""
  From plain reading of the aforesaid provisions, it reveals that person who is continuously in possession for four harvests immediately preceding Khareef, 1973 shall first be officered for sale of the said property unless an order of ejectment has been passed against him in respect of such land. The petitioner has annexed copies of ""Khasra Girdawaries"" with this petition to establish his right of first purchase. From minute scrutiny of these documents (Khasra Girdawaries), it is established that these ""Khasra Girdawaries"" pertained to the crops Rabi 1986-87 Kharif, 1992-93 to Rabi 1994 and crops of 2004 to 2005. There is no evidence or document showing possession of the petitioner over the land in dispute of the crops mentioned in the proviso to subsection (1), clause (b) of section 3 of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons (Repeal) Act, 1975. The petitioner has not been able to prove his possession continuously for four harvests preceding Kharif, 1973. Therefore, the property in dispute could not be offered for purchase to the petitioner as first purchaser. The petitioner came forward claiming to be the first purchaser for the first time when he filed writ petition before the High Court, Multan Bench, on 28-9-2006. If at all, he was a tenant of the land, he has not produced any evidence that under whose orders and permission he occupied the land. Secondly, why he kept silent over his right and remained in a state of dormancy for such a long period? Thirdly the order dated 30-4-2004 has been challenged after the expiry of about three years.
  7. As to the case referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner i.e. Ali Muhammad (supra), the same is not attracted and applicable to all the four corners of the present case. The case Ahmed and 25 others (ibid), is also not helpful to the petitioner, rather it support. The opponent of the petitioner. The relevant portion of paragraph (b) of this judgment is reproduced as under:--
  ""There is no cavil with the proposition that existence of laches is sufficient for dismissal in limine of petition.""
  8. The writ petition filed by the petitioner has been dismissed by the High Court applying the principle of ""Laches"" and it has been laid down by the superior Court that if the order is not challenged within the reasonable time, the vested legal right is accrued to the person in whose favour the impugned order is passed. In the instant case, after the acceptance of their ""Mukhbari"" application and direction of the Settlement Authorities, the allotment of land in favour of the ""Mukhbar"", a vested right has been accrued to him. Respondent No.2 is the son of Nawab Khan (Mukhbar) and he cannot be deprived of a valuable legal right which .he acquired due to negligence of the petitioner. This argument is further fortified by the dictum laid down by this Court in the cases of Rehmatullah and others v. Ulas Khan and others 1968 SCMR 975, Abdul Hamid v. Chief Settlement Commissioner and others 1968 SCMR 120, Rahim Bux v. Settlement Authorities and others 1968 SCMR 78, Ahmad Din v. Mst. Rasul Bibi 1968 SCMR 843, Masooda Begum through Legal Heirs v. Government of, Punjab through Secretary Forest, Lahore and 9 others PLD 2003 SC 90.
  9. In view of above discussion and following the principle laid down by this Court in the cases referred to above, we do not find any illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment of the High Court, which is unexceptionable.
  10. The upshot of what has been discussed above is that this petition being devoid of any force is liable to be dismissed. Hence, the same is dismissed and leave to appeal refused.

    ORDER
  CH. IJAZ AHMED, J.---The petitioners have sought leave to appeal against the judgment of the Lahore Nigh Court, dated 13-4-2001 wherein the learned High Court 'had accepted the R.S.A. filed by the respondents and set aside the concurrent findings of fact recorded in favour of the petitioners and dismissed the suit of the petitioners.
  2. Necessary facts out of which the present petition arises are that petitioners/their predecessors-in-interest filed a suit for possession of land in question against the respondents in the Court of Civil Judge 1st Class, Jhang on 18-4-1973. The contents of the plaint reveal that predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners, namely, Qasim, Gamman, Shamun Nizam, Pehlwan and Sultan mortgaged their land measuring 390 Kanals, 3 Marlas situated in Khata No.23 and one half share situated in Khata Nos.24 and 25 measuring 148 Kanals, 9 Marlas and 101 Kanals, 6 Marlas respectively as depicted from Misal Haqiayat for the year 1924-25 of Village Paharpur, District Jhang in favour of two evacuees namely Chanan Dass and Melap Ram sons of Khota Ram. Predecessor -in-interest of the petitioners filed an application before the Collector, Jhang for redemption of the land in question on 28-5-1928. During the course of proceedings of redemption, the parties agreed to settle the dispute through arbitration. In view of said agreement Mian Noor Muhammad Cheela and Mehr Bahadur Khan were appointed as Arbitrators in terms of the agreement arrived at between the parties. The Arbitrators announced the award on 22-6-1929. The award was submitted before the Collector who disposed of the matter vide order, dated 30-9-1929. In view of order of the Collector dated 30-9-1929, the Mutation No.337 was sanctioned in favour of the mortgagees on 30-9-1929. The contents of the plaint further reveal that entire Khata No.23 pertaining to land measuring 390 Kanals stood redeemed under the award while 1/4th share each in Khata Nos.24 and 25 was to be sold in favour of the evacuee mortgagees in lieu of the consideration mentioned in the award and 1/4th share each i.e. Khata Nos.24 and 25 stood redeemed in favour of the mortgagors/predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners. The Collector did not pass order in terms of award dated 22-6-1929 and while passing the order, dated 30-9-1929 misconstrue the terms of the award and erroneously allowed the sale of half share of the land of Khata Nos.24 and 25 in favour of the mortgagees. The contents of the plaint further reveal that on account of the aforesaid error committed by the Collector while misconstruing award vide order, dated 30-9-1929 Mutation No.337 was sanctioned in favour of the mortgagees on 30-9-1929. The contents of the plaint further reveal that after partition of the Sub-Continent and on the creation of Pakistan, the non-muslims inclusive of the mortgagees had migrated to India. The disputed land was wrongly treated to be evacuee property and allotted in favour of the Noor Muhammad etc. in the year 1956 which was purchased by the respondents from the allottees. The respondents filed written statement, controverted the allegations levelled in the plaint. Out of the divergent pleas/pleadings of the parties, the trial Court framed 7 issues and thereafter recorded the evidence of the parties. The learned Civil Judge 1st Class Jhang/trial Court, decreed the suit vide judgment and decree, dated 31-1-1982. The respondents being, aggrieved filed appeal in the Court of Additional District Judge, who dismissed the same vide judgment and decree, dated 11-10-1983. Respondents being aggrieved filed R.S.A. in the Lahore High Court which was accepted vide impugned judgment as mentioned above. Hence this petition.
  3. The learned counsel submits that learned High Court had erred in law to disturb the concurrent findings of fact recorded by the Courts below while exercising power under section 100, C.P.C. He further submits that order of the Collector was void as the learned Collector had passed the order in violation of the contents of the award dated 22-6-1929. He further submits that basic order of the Collector dated 30-9-1929 was without lawful authority, therefore, learned High Court was not justified to set aside the concurrent findings of fact recorded by the Courts below qua the issue of jurisdiction and limitation. He further submits that Civil Courts being Courts of plenary jurisdiction, conferred on them by section 9 of Civil Procedure Code, 1908, would retain jurisdiction in cases where the orders of public functionaries are without lawful authority in spite of the bar of jurisdiction through a special law. In support of his contention, he relied upon Muhammad Jamil Asghar's case PLD -1965 SC 698. He further maintains that limitation cannot run against the void order.
  4. The learned counsel for the respondents supported the impugned judgment.
  5. We have considered the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. It is better and appropriate to reproduce basic facts in chronological order to resolve the controversy between the parties:
  (i) Predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners had mortgaged the land in question in favour of non-muslims before partition.
  (ii) Predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners filed application for redemption of the property in question before the Collector on 28-5-1928.
  (iii) During the proceedings of redemption, parties agreed to settle the dispute through arbitration.
  (iv) Mian Noor Muhammad Cheela and Mehr Bahadur Khan were appointed arbitrators who announced the award on 22-6-1929 with specific particulars with regard to redemption as mentioned in preceding paragraphs.
  (v) Collector passed the order on 30-9-1929 in violation of terms of award and Mutation No.337 was sanctioned in favour of the mortgagees on 30-9-1929 in terms of the order of Collector, dated 30-9-1929.
  (vi) Predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners did not challenge the order of the Collector in their life time.
  (vii) After the partition, non-muslims had migrated to India and land in question remained in their name in view of order, dated 30-9-1929 of the Collector. The said land was treated to be evacuee property which was allotted in favour of Noor Muhammad etc. in the year 1956 which was purchased by the respondents from the allottees.
  (viii) Petitioners filed suit before the trial Court on 18-4-1973.
  6. In case the aforesaid facts are put in a juxtaposition, then it is crystal clear that the respondents had purchased the land in question from the allottee before filing of the suit by the petitioners/their predecessor-in-interest before the Civil Court on 18-4-1973. This fact alone is sufficient to come to the conclusion that respondents had not committed any fraud or misrepresentation at the time of the purchasing the land in question from the allottees. It is pertinent to mention here that in the case in hand allottees had also not committed any fraud or misrepresentation at the time of allotment of the land in question in their name. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners has no force that learned High Court had erred in law to dismiss the suit of the petitioners through the impugned judgment as the order of the Collector was void as law laid down by this Court in S. Sharif Ahmad Hashmi's case 1980 SCMR 711. The relevant observation is as follows:--
  ""This passage does not mean that a void order is always to be struck down regardless of the consequences of such a decision, but that a void order must be struck down provided there is no statute or principle of law which would make it unjust or inequitable to strike down the void order. This qualification is very important, and that is why, for example, a writ may be refused against a void order if this would enable the petitioner to circumvent the provisions of a statute of limitation.""
  7. It is an admitted fact land in question was treated as evacuee property which was allotted in the year 1956. The petitioners had filed suit without impleading the Custodian Evacuee Property as defendant in their suit. Therefore, the suit of the petitioners was liable to be dismissed. See Zafar Iqbal's case NLR 1996 UC 452. It is pertinent to mention here that the object and the purpose of the evacuee laws were to compensate and rehabilitate the refugees who migrated to Pakistan at the time of partition of Indo-Pak Sub-Continent. This is, thus, a right guaranteed to such refugees under Article 2-A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and the evacuee laws on the subject for their settlement and Rehabilitation in the economic life of Pakistan. It is a settled law that longstanding entries in Jamabandis does have presumption of truth. The Mutation No.337 was sanctioned on 30-9-1929, therefore, after partition land in question was properly c treated by the authorities as evacuee. The petitioners had filed a suit with regard to. the determination of the status of the land in question before the Civil Court and the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to take the cognizance of the matter. See Muhammad Ramzan's case NLR 1995 UC 43. It is also a settled law that constitutional jurisdiction is discretionary in character. He who seeks equity must come with clean hands and must be vigilant qua his rights. As mentioned above in case whole facts are put in a juxtaposition, then equity demands that the petition be dismissed as the respondents had purchased the land in question from the allottees well in time and the petitioners did not challenge the original order, dated 30-9-1929 and also did not challenge the same well within time when the land in question was treated as evacuee property. In view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case coupled with conduct of the petitioners, we are not inclined to exercise our discretion in favour of the petitioners as law laid down by this Court in the following judgments:
  (i) Haji Saifullah Khan's case PLD 1989 SC 166, (ii) Wali Muhammad's case PLD 1974 SC 106, (iii) Khawaja Sharif's case PLD 1988 Lah. 725, (iv) G.M. Malik's case 1990 CLC 1783, (v) Nawab Syed Raunak Ali's case PLD 1973 SC 236 and (vi) Rana Muhammad Arshad's case 1998 SCMR 1462.
  8. For what has been discussed above, this petition has no merit which is dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.

    JUDGMENT
  CH. IJAZ AHMED, J.--- We intend to decide captioned appeals by one consolidated judgment having similar facts and law arising out of the common judgment of the Lahore High Court, dated 30-10-2001.
  2. Appellants/petitioners had sought leave to appeal against the judgment of the Lahore High Court, dated 13-10-2001 wherein the revision petitions filed by the private respondents were accepted through the impugned judgment.
  3. Necessary facts out of which the aforesaid appeals have been arisen are that respondents filed suit for declaration along with permanent injunction and consequential relief against the appellants in the Court of Civil Judge, First Class Khushab to the effect that all the orders passed by the Revenue Authorities against them were illegal and void. Petition filed by respondent No.1 in present Civil Appeal No.166 of 2003 reveals that land in question was allotted on 4-3-1960 as depicted from Roznamcha No.353, dated 8-7-1969. The contents of the plaint further reveal that possession of the land in question was given to the respondent by the appellants in the year 1960. The contents of the plaint further reveal that the allotment order and Rapat Roznamcha about allotment and possession in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs, were misplaced by the official of the appellants mala fide, there EACO/ Collector Jauharabad after enquiry held that the allotment in favour of the respondents was bogus vide order, dated 27-9-1981 which order was upheld by the Additional Commissioner (Revenue), however, in revision Member Board of Revenue remanded the case to the Assistant Commissioner/Collector Sub-Division Noorpur Thal for decision afresh who again decided the case against the respondents/plaintiffs on 10-12-1989 thereafter appeals and revision filed by the respondents were dismissed vide orders, dated 28-2-1989 and 5-12-1991 by Additional Commissioner and Member Board of Revenue. Similar are the facts of the connected appeals. Appellants filed written statement controverting the allegations levelled in the plaint. Out of the pleadings of the parties, the trial Court framed eight issues. Learned trial Court after completing the legal formalities such as recording of evidence of the parties decreed the suit vide judgment and decree, dated 10-5-1997. The appellants being aggrieved filed appeals in the Court of Additional District Judge, Khushab which were accepted vide judgment, dated 7-8-2000. Private respondents being aggrieved filed civil revisions in the Lahore High Court which were accepted vide impugned consolidated judgment, hence the appellants/petitioners filed civil petitions before this Court which were fixed before this Court on 3-2-2003 when leave was granted in the following terms:-
  ""Leave to appeal is granted to consider whether in the absence of any allotment order by the competent authority mere report in Roznameha Waqiati' could confer right to claim proprietary rights in addition to the effect of jurisdictional bar, perceived by the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912.""
4. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that learned First Appellate Court was justified to non-suit the private respondents with cogent reasons keeping in view the law laid down by this Court in a similar case in Writ Petition No.11989 of 1980 titled Noor Muhammad and others v. EACO and others. She further submits that respondents have no allotment letter in their favour which fact was not considered by the trial Court in true perspective as well as by the High Court and this fact was considered by the First Appellate Court in its true perspective. She further submits that mere entries in the Roznamcha do not confer any title in favour of the private respondents. She further submits that Civil Court has no jurisdiction to take the cognizance of the matter and entertaining the suit in view of section 36 of the Colonization of Government Land (Punjab) Act, 1912.
  5. Learned counsel for the respondents has supported the impugned judgment. He submits that learned trial Court was justified while ignoring the judgment of the High Court in the aforesaid writ petition as the private respondents were not party in the said writ petition. He' further submits that First Appellate Court erred in law to reverse the findings of trial Court on Issues Nos.5 to 7 without any justification and without judicial application of mint. He further submits that learned High Court has given findings of fact against the appellants after proper appreciation of evidence on record and this Court normally does not interfere in the findings of fact recorded by learned High Court while exercising its powers under Article 185(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.
  6. We have given our due consideration to the contentions of the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
7. It is admitted fact that in Writ Petition No.11989 of 1.980 private respondents were not party therefore, learned First Appellate Court erred in law to non-suit the private respondents in view of the order of the High Court. The judgment of the High Court in the said writ petition is judgment in personam there fore, learned First Appellate Court has erred in law to non-suit the private respondents on the basis of judgment of the High Court which is not in consonance the law laid down by this Court in Pir Bakhsh v. The Chairman, Allotment Committee and others PLD 1987 SC 145. It is also settled principle of law that judicial officers are duty bound to decide the cases after judicial application of mind as law laid down by this Court in Gouranga Mohan Sikdar's case PLD 1970 SC 158. It is also settled principle of law that judgment of this Court is binding on each and every organ of the State by virtue of Articles 189 and 190 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. In view of aforesaid reasons the High Court was justified to reverse the findings of First Appellate Court while exercising powers under section 115, C.P.C. It is pertinent to mention here that the learned trial Court had considered each and every piece of evidence on record while rendering the finding of fact qua Issues No.5 to 7 in favour of the respondents in paras.9, 10 and 11 consisting of eight pages. The said findings were reversed by the First Appellate Court without application of mind as is evident from the operative part of the findings of First Appellate Court which is as under:--
  ""(12) The Court decided these issues together against the order of remand. The plaintiffs-respondents could not prove their allotment under the scheme. The Revenue Officers found the respondents as lessees. The findings of the Revenue Officers are not open to challenge. The order of the Additional Commissioner and Board of Revenue are against the respondents. The orders are neither illegal nor in any way mala fide and without authority. The findings on Issues Nos.5 to 7 are also reversed.""
8. It is also settled law that it is the duty and obligation of the First Appellate Court to reverse the findings of trial Court by meeting the reasoning of the trial Court as law lard down by this Court in Madan Gopal and 4 others v. Maran Bepari and 3 others PLD 1969 SC 617 whereas mere reading of the aforesaid findings of First Appellate Court clearly shows that First Appellate Court had reversed the findings on Issues Nos.5 to 7 without judicial application of mind and in violation of dictum laid down by this Court in Madan Gopal's case (Supra). In this view of the matter learned High Court was justified to reverse the judgment of the First Appellate Court after judicial application of mind while discussing each and every piece of evidence as is evident from paragraphs Nos.9 to 11 of the impugned judgment. The plea raised by learned counsel for the appellant that Civil Court had no jurisdiction to take the cognizance of the matter has no force in view of the law laid down by this Court in (i) PLD 1960 SC 113, (ii) Abdul Rab and others v. Wali Muhammad and others 1980 SCMR 139 and (iii) Muhammad Jamil Asghar v. The Improvement Trust, Rawalpindi PLD 1965 SC 698. It is pertinent to mention here that different statutes provide that an order made by the authority acting under it shall not be called in question in any Court. The intentions of the Legislature in their wisdom qua section 36 of Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 are that the officers working under the Act should exercise their powers freely and should not be interrupted unnecessarily to administer colony land according to the terms and conditions issued by the competent authority off and on but this provision does not give unfettered power. The ambit of jurisdiction has been prescribed by the Act and the officers functioning there under cannot be allowed to act beyond their scope of jurisdiction. The Civil Court while exercising supervisory jurisdiction has the authority to interfere, if the orders are without jurisdiction, mala fide, excessive or otherwise not in accordance with law or based on fraud. This proposition of law was considered by the Privy Council in Secretary of State v. Mask and Company AIR 1940 PC 105 and laid down the following principles:--
  ""The exclusion of jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is not to be readily inferred but that such exclusion must either be explicitly expressed or clearly implied. It is also well-settled that even if jurisdiction is so excluded, the Civil Courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied, or the statutory Tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure.
  The aforesaid proposition of law was considered by this Court in Zafarul Ahsan's case (supra) and laid down following principles:--
  ""Of course where the proceedings are taken mala fide and the statute is used merely as a cloak to cover an act which in fact is not taken though it purports to have been taken under the statute, the order will not, in accordance with a long line of decisions in England and in this sub-continent, be treated as an order under the statute.""
  There are several pronouncements of the superior Courts that Civil Court in spite of the exclusive power has jurisdiction to take the cognizance of the matter in case the authorities under the Special Law have passed the order in violation of Rules and Regulations or mala fide. It is also settled law that manner of exercising power is also termed as mala fide as law laid down by this Court in Agha Shorash Kashmiri's case PLD 1969 SC 14. The aforesaid proposition of law with regard to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is supported by following judgments:--
(1) Khadim Hussain's case PLD 1967 Lah. 915, (2) Muhammad Amin's case NLD 1998 Rev. 47, (3) Jewana's case PLD 1954 Lah. 253, (4) Karam Dad's case PLD 1978 Lah. 679, (5) Muhammad Saleh's case 1980 CLC 662, (6) Muhammad Ibrahim's case PLD 1960 Lah. 1106, (7) Masood Ali's case PLD 1950 Lah. 340, (8) Anjuman-e-Taleem-ul-Islam's .case PLD 1983 Lah. 294, (9) Hamayun's case 1997 MLD 2669, (10) Muhammad Akram's case PLD 1993 Lah. 114, (11) Nawab Din's case 2003 CLC 1922, (12) Fateh Muhammad's case 2002 CLC 639, (13) Muhammad Zafar's case 2003 CLC 1922, (14) Muhammad Saleh's case 1980 CLC 662, (15) Khadim Hussain's case 1970 SCMR 127 and (16) Muhammad Shaft's case 1982 CLC 55.
  The ratio of the aforesaid judgments is that section 36 of the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 is available only where the authorities concerned acted within powers and four corners of their jurisdiction and not their acts are ultra vires or without jurisdiction or void or in excess of their jurisdiction. It is pertinent to mention here that trial Court, as mentioned above, has given findings of fact against the appellants that orders were passed by the appellants against the respondents mala fide, without jurisdiction. The said findings were approved by the learned High Court in the impugned judgment, therefore, contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that Civil Court had no jurisdiction to take the cognizance of the matter and entertain the suit filed by the respondent has no force. It is settled principle of law that public functionaries are duty bound to pass the orders in accordance with law in view of Article 4 of the Constitution or the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as law laid down by this Court in Utility Stores Corporation of Pakistan Ltd. v. Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal and others PLD 1987 SC 447. Both the Courts below i.e. trial Court and the Lahore High Court have given concurrent conclusion against the appellant that officials of the appellants had misplaced the original record and the appellants had not taken any action against them. It is settled law that nobody should be penalized for the act of the public functionaries as law laid down by this Court in Umer Din (deceased) through L.Rs. and others v. Abdul Rahim and others 2005 SCMR 496.
  9. Both the Courts below i.e. trial Court and the High Court have given concurrent conclusion against the appellants. This Court does not normally, interfere in the concurrent conclusion arrived at by the Courts below under Article 185(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as laid down by this Court in Muhammad Ishaque's case PLD 1977 SC 109. Learned counsel for the appellants has failed to bring the case within the parameters prescribed by this Court in Muhammad Ishaque's case (supra).
  10. We do not find any infirmity or illegality in the impugned judgment passed by the Lahore High Court therefore, appeals are dismissed with no order as to costs.

    JUDGMENT
  MUHAMMAD NAWAZ ABBASI, J.---These connected petitions involving common question of law and facts, are proposed to be disposed of through this single judgment. Leave to appeal has been sought in these petitions under Article 185(3) of the Constitution against the judgment, dated 26-4-2004 passed by a learned Judge in Chamber of High Court of Sindh at Karachi in constitution petitions arising out of ejectment petitions filed by the private respondents against the petitioners under section 15 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 (hereinafter called the Ordinance).
  2. The petitioners in the above petitions, are in possession of the Flats, bearing Nos.3/2, 3rd Floor and 4/2 4th Floor, Kamal Manzil Opposite KMC Building, M.A. Jinnah Road, Karachi as tenants and respondents Nos.3 to 8, hereinafter called the landlords, seeking their eviction from the premises in their possession, filed separate ejectment petitions against them in the Court of Rent Controller, Karachi South, on the ground of default in payment of rent. The petitioners denied the relationship of landlord and tenant with the assertion that the premises in question were actually owned by one Arshad Hidayatullah and they in pursuance of the notice under section 18 of the Ordinance sent to them, have deposited rent in his name as per requirement of law. The ejectment petitions were allowed by the Rent Controller and the orders of the eviction of petitioners were further upheld by the learned Additional District Judge (South) Karachi in separate appeals filed by the petitioners vide judgment dated 20-12-2003. On dismissal of the writ petitions filed by the petitioners in the High Court against their eviction, they have preferred the present petitions.
  3. Learned counsel for the petitioners, without acknowledging the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties admitted that initially the petitioners were inducted in the premises as tenants by the respondents later on their refusal to receive the rent, the petitioners tendered the rent through money orders but in the meanwhile on receipt of notice under section 18 of the Ordinance, sent by the real owner they deposited the rent in his name. The learned counsel agued that in the given situation, the non-payment of rent to the respondents would not be considered default in terms of section 15 of the Ordinance as without establishing the title, the respondents would not be entitled to receive the rent and consequently the order of the eviction of petitioners was passed without lawful authority. In nutshell, the contention of the learned counsel was that in consequence to the cancellation of the allotment of the property in the name of predecessor-in-interest of respondents by the Board of Revenue, Government of Sindh, they ceased to be the owner of the premises and having lost the status of landlord, would have no locus standi to maintain the ejectment petition. In the alternate, he asserted that the petitioners being under bona fide impression that respondents were no more landlords of the premises, deposited rent in the name of Arshad Hidayatullah and thus, in law they would not be treated as wilful defaulter to entail the penalty of ejectment.
  4. The petitioners having admitted their induction in the premises in their possession as tenant by the respondent, have accepted the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant between them and the respondents, therefore, notwithstanding any defect in the title of the respondents, they would be estopped to deny the relationship of landlord and tenant at a subsequent stage on the ground that a third person having setup his title in the property, has sent them a notice under section 18 of the Ordinance. The ownership of the property is not an essential condition to create relationship of landlord and tenant rather a person without being owner of the property may acquire the status of landlord of the property, therefore, the defect in the title of landlord may not be as such a valid ground to deny his status as landlord of the property and thus, non-payment of rent for such reason may constitute a wilful default in terms of section 15 of the Ordinance which provides that if the tenancy between the parties is based on a written agreement, the tenant must pay rent of the premises in his possession within 15 days after expiry of period of payment of rent fixed in the agreement and in absence of any written agreement within 60 days after rent becomes due failing which tenant must face the consequence of ejectment. The petitioners by their conduct of denying the status of respondents as landlords of the premises on the pretext of defect in their title subsequent to their induction in the premises as tenant by the respondents, have disentitled themselves from seeking equitable relief in the ejectment petition. This may be seen that the petitioners having taken contradictory pleas at various stages in the proceedings have not only committed default in payment of rent but also disowned the respondents as landlord of the premises in their possession, knowingly that the order by virtue of which the allotment in the name of predecessor-in-interest of the respondents, was cancelled by the Board of Revenue, was under challenge before the High Court. The dispute regarding the title of the respondents being sub judice in the High Court, the petitioner who were initially inducted in the premises as tenant by the respondents neither were justified in asking them to establish their title to maintain their status as landlord of the property nor could deny the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant. This Court has repeatedly held that in such an eventuality, the tenant must face the penal consequence of ejectment and reference may be made to Muhammad Yousuf v. Asghar Hussain 1980 SCMR 886; Amanullh Khan v. Chotay Khan 1978 SCMR 14 and Muhammad Shah Alam v. Muhammad Abdul Ghafoor 1979 SCMR 443. The learned counsel for the petitioners has not been able to point out any misreading or non-reading of evidence or any legal infirmity in the concurrent findings of the three Courts on a question of fact relating to the default in the payment of rent by the petitioners or regarding the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties.
  5. In the light of foregoing discussion, we do not find any substance in this petition and the same is accordingly dismissed with costs. Leave refused.

  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, J.--- Petitioners seek leave to appeal against the judgment dated 20th February, 2001 passed by the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, Multan.
(2). Precisely stating facts of the case are that predecessor-in-interest of Feroze Din got allotted a State land in Square No.95, Chak No.19/9-R, Tehsil Khanewal, District Multan, allegedly under the Criminal Tribes Scheme to non-Muslims Tenants. It is pertinent to note that statedly the land was in possession of non-Muslim Evacuee Occupancy Tenant and Government had decided to allot the State land to Evacuees who had migrated from India against their verified claim. Subsequently litigation between the predecessor-in-interest of the respondents and one Nabu who was in occupation of the land started and ultimately the Member, Board of Revenue cancelled the allotment from the name of Feroze Din in Square No.95 and remanded the case to the District Collector, Multan to examine the entitlement of Nabu on the land in dispute. After the death of Feroze Din his successor-in-interest filed Writ Petition No.1303 of 1969 before learned High Court which was disposed of vide judgment dated 18th October, 1972, whereby learned High Court made observation that if Nabu fails to establish his claim that he is an old allottee of the disputed land under the said scheme, both Nabu and Feroze Din will be heard for their entitlement afresh under this scheme. On remand of the case the District Collector, Multan vide order dated 12th June, 1973 observed that both of them are not previous allotted of the disputed land. This order was challenged by the predecessor-in-interest of the respondents within the hierarchy of Land Revenue Laws. Ultimately the Member, Board of Revenue on 8th June, 1974 maintained the order dated 12th June, 1973 passed by the District Collector. As such another Writ Petition No.1708 of 1974 before the High Court was filed by the respondents which was dismissed. After the dismissal of writ petition matter again went before the Revenue Authorities on the behest of legal heirs of Nabu as well as respondents. On 21st December, 1982 the Member, Board of Revenue observed that both are not entitled for the allotment of the land, as such respondents instituted another Writ Petition No.261 of 1983 which has been disposed of by means to impugned judgment.
  (3). Learned counsel for petitioners contended that the respondents are not entitled for the allotment of the land because their claim has been rejected as back as on 12th June, 1973 by means of order passed by the District Collector, Multan and subsequent order passed by the Member, Board of Revenue, dated 21st December, 1982. He further contended that learned High Court without taking into consideration that as far as the allotment in favour of the predecessor-in-interest of respondent Feroze Din, under the claim for allotment of land to certain criminal Tribes is concerned, it was abolished as back as in the year 1961 whereas the allotment in favour of Feroze Din was made in the year 1968 which was cancelled as he was not found entitled to retain possession of the land. It is also his case that there is discrepancy in the impugned judgment because in respect of claim of predecessor-in-interest for allotment of land in Square No.95 learned Single Judge in Chambers of High Court had obtained a report from the Assistant Collector to ascertain as to whether respondents are in possession of different Killa numbers situated in Square No.94 and on the basis of same it was observed that they are in cultivating possession so that are entitled for the allotment of land.
  (5). On the other hand learned counsel for caveat contended that the allotment was made in favour of Feroze Din under the Criminal Tribes Scheme to non-Muslim Tenants meant for the allotment of land to the Criminal Tribes and subsequently, vide notification dated 16th January, 2002 has been validated, therefore, respondents being in cultivating position has obtained the status of owners under this notification and for such reason learned High Court has rightly disposed of the matter, in their favour.
  (6). After hearing both the sides, following questions emerged for consideration:--
  (1). Whether under order dated 10th December, 1968 predecessor-in- interest of respondent namely Feroze Din could have obtained the disputed land under the Criminal Tribes Scheme to non-Muslims Tenants as it was admittedly abolished in the year 1961?
  (2). Whether after the judgment passed by the learned High Court in the earlier round of litigation in Writ Petitions Nos. 1303 of 1969 and 1078 of 1974 the respondents have succeeded to establish their entitlement on the disputed land under any scheme if so to what effect?
  (3). Whether merely for the reason that respondents are in cultivating possession of the land in dispute can claim its ownership under notification dated 16th January, 2002?","  2006 S C M R 975

  JUDGMENT
  MUNIR A. SHEIKH, J.--- This petition is directed against judgment dated 6-3-2003 of the Lahore High Court whereby Constitution petition filed by the petitioner has been dismissed.
  2. Sultan, father of the petitioner and respondent No.4, was the allottee of land under Horse Breeding Scheme who died in 1991. After his death the matter came up before the Revenue Authorities for re-allotment of the lease to anyone of his suitable legal heirs. The contest was between the petitioner and respondent No.4. The petitioner is son of Sultan from his first wife whereas the respondent No.4 is also his son from second wife. The Remount Officer after considering the case of the parties in comparison to each other came to the conclusion that respondent No.4 was more suitable for he had been dealing with the bound animals during the life time of his father and looking after the lease, therefore, he recommended him for allotment. On the other hand, the Collector came to the conclusion that two criminal cases had been registered against respondent No.4 and that the petitioner being senior in age had more experience, therefore, lease should be allotted to him in preference to respondent No.4. He made allotment in favour of the petitioner vide his order dated 12-10-1992.
  3. The appeal filed by respondent No.4 was accepted by the Commissioner, Multan Division, vide order dated 9-5-1994. It was held that the recommendations of the Remount Officer were in favour of respondent No.4 which had to be taken into consideration before making allotment while determining suitability of one of the two heirs which the Collector did not do. The report of the Remount Officer was taken into consideration and it was found that respondent No.4 was more suitable for he had been acquitted from the two criminal cases registered against him and had also been issued covering certificates for his experience in dealing with the bound animals. The revision petition filed by the petitioner before the Board of Revenue was dismissed vide order, dated 28-10-1988 against which Constitution petition filed by the petitioner has been dismissed through the impugned judgment, dated 6-3-2003 against which leave is sought.
  4. It has been rightly pointed out by the learned Single Judge of the High Court that the question of suitability was a matter decision about which was to be made by the Revenue Authorities and if these Authorities had found one of the two legal heirs more fit and suitable as compared to the other, the same could not be substituted on merits in Constitutional jurisdiction on the ground that it was without lawful authority unless it was established that the decision of the Revenue Authorities was violative of any law on the subject to render it without lawful authority.
  5. In this case both the Commissioner and Board of Revenue have found that the petitioner had no experience as compared to respondent No.4 in dealing with the bound animals, who had been looking after the lease during the life time of his father and that the Remount Officer had also recommended his name, who was the concerned person, who had to provide evidence about the suitability of the proposed allottee. Unless the Revenue Authorities dealing with the matter had found by express order that recommendations of the Remount Officer was not in accordance with law and based on cogent reasons, the same could be reversed, but in this case the Collector while passing order in favour of the petitioner did not bother to attend to the said recommendations. The recommendations made by the Remount Officer show that before making the same he heard all the concerned persons and found respondent No.4 more suitable. These recommendations were not found to be incorrect or improper on any ground by any of the Revenue Authorities rather the Commissioner and Board of Revenue agreed with him, therefore, it was not a case where orders passed by the Board of Revenue and Commissioner could legally be declared without lawful authority.
  6. For the foregoing reasons, we do ,not find any merit in this petition which is accordingly dismissed and leave refused.

  ORDER
  FAQIR MUHAMMAD KHOKHAR, J----This petition for leave to appeal is directed against judgment, dated 4-2-1999 passed by the Lahore High Court, Lahore in Civil Revision No.2959-D of 1996.
  2. The respondent filed a suit, against the petitioner, for declaration that he, being an allottee by the Land Reforms Authorities, was owner in possession of the suit - land measuring 196 Kanals and 16 Marlas situated in Mauza Pabbarwala; Tehsil Chiniot, District Jhang, and that the entries in Jamabandi for the year 1983-84 showing the petitioner as owner of the suit property were illegal, void and ineffective. In his written statement, the petitioner took the position that the suit-land having been resumed under the Martial Law Regulation No.64 was allotted to him, as its tenant, on payment by instalments.
  3. The trial Court, after framing the issues and recording the evidence, decreed the suit of the respondent by judgment and decree dated 22-11-1995. The appeal and Civil Revision No.2959-D of 1996 of the petitioner were dismissed, vide judgments dated 19-10-1996 and 4-2-1999 respectively, by the Additional District Judge and the Lahore High Court, Lahore. Hence this petition for leave to appeal'.
  4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner was duly allotted the suit property, vide order, dated 16-4-1964, by the Assistant Land Commissioner in lieu his earlier allotment. The respondent had manipulated, in his favour, certain entries in the Revenue Record by adding therein the name of his father Soina. The cultivation of the suit property by the petitioner and his forefathers was admitted by P.W.1 the allotment and cultivation of the land by the petitioner was also proved through D.W.5, son of the declarant under M.L.R.64. The learned counsel lastly contended that the documentary evidence (Exh.D.1 to Exh.D.4) of the petitioner was not properly considered and that the evidence of the respondent was misread by the Courts.
  5. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the suit-land had been duly allotted in favour of the respondent by the Land Reforms Authorities on payment of Government dues. The allotment was given to further effect by the Revenue Authorities in the operations of consolidation of the land holdings of the village. A Mutation No.686 (Exh.P.12) of the suit-land was also attested by the Revenue Authorities on 4-10-1980 in favour of the respondent. The concurrent findings of fact were recorded by the Courts after proper evaluation and appreciation of evidence on record.
  6. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length. We find that all the three Courts have recorded concurrent findings of fact on the basis of voluminous evidence on record that the suit-land was validly allotted to the respondent by the Land Reforms Authorities after its resumption from the declarant. The respondent had also paid the instalments and other dues in respect of the same and Mutation No.686 Exh.P.12 was also attested in his favour. The findings of the Lahore High Court in pra.6 of the impugned judgment are reproduced below:
  ""(6) The evidence produced by the plaintiff-respondent indicates that he has paid the price of the land in question in instalments to the Government through form L.C. No.XIV, Exh.P.1 from 30-7-1960 to 31-7-1971. The payments of the instalments were regularly made by the respondent to the Government. Similarly the other documents relied upon by the respondent Exh.P.2, copy of Mutation No.686 indicates that the land in dispute previously belonged to the Provincial Government and was mutated in his name through this mutation. The petitioner has relied upon Jamabandi for the year 1983-84 and the receipts of payments Exhs.D.1 to D.4. These documents are not sufficient to conclude that the petitioner is owner of the property in dispute. Form LC.XI at page 97 of the petition manifests that some allotment was made in favour of petitioner Mahmood son of Bahawal but same was reviewed by the Deputy Land Commissioner vide order, dated 26-5-1962 and new Khatoni was ordered to be distributed by canceling the aforesaid land. This order was passed by Assistant Land Commissioner on 16-4-1964. This document indicates that the allotment, if any of the petitioner was cancelled subsequently. The overwhelming documentary evidence Exhs.P.I to P.12 produced by respondent on the record clearly shows that he was the owner of the land in dispute. The plea of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the respondent got erased his father's name and substituted the name of Soina, his father is not established on the record. The documentary evidence placed on the record clearly shows that the respondent was allotted the land in dispute under the Land Reforms and a mischief was played by the petitioner being an namesake of the respondent by manoeuvering a change of father's name in the column of father's name in the Jamabandi in question. Learned A counsel for the petitioner has not been able to point out any misreading and non-reading of the material evidence placed on the record.""
  7. No exception can be taken to the conclusions drawn by the
High Court after taking the evidence of the parties into consideration. The petitioner could not prove that the suit-land was ever allotted to him. The impugned judgment of the Lahore High Court does not call for any interference. This is not a fit case for grant of leave to appeal.
  8. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any merit in this petition and the same is dismissed accordingly.

  JUDGMENT
  KHALIL-UR-REHMAN RAMDAY, J.-------Civil Petitions Nos.2972-L to 2989-L of 2000 are being disposed of together through this single order as all of them involve identical facts and similar questions of law.
  2. The respondents/their predecessors-in-interest migrated from India as a result of the partitioning of the Sub-Continent and settled in Village Ghazi Kakka of Tehsil Ferozewala in District Sheikhupura where they were allotted lands against their verified claims. The lands falling in the said village Ghazi Kakka got included in the Border Belt whereafter the above mentioned allotments made in favour of the respondents/their predecessors-in-interest were cancelled which finally led them to the Lahore High Court through Writ Petition No.930/R of 1970 and others complaining inter alia, that they had been condemned unheard as the impugned action had been taken against them without notice to them and without affording any opportunity to them to defend against the same. All these writ petitions were decided by the learned High Court through a common judgment, dated 6-10-1979. The operative paragraph of the said judgment is reproduced hereunder:--
  ""I accept these petitions and remand the cases to the Border Area Committee for an inquiry in each case after giving notice to all concerned. If it is found that the petitioners or any of the petitioners allotment, as the case may, is/are valid, the allotment/allotments to the respondents in such case/cases shall stand set aside and if the petitioners or any of the petitioners are/is found to have obtained allotment/allotments fraudulently, the allotment/ allotments in favour of the respondents to that extent shall not be effected. Parties will be at liberty to lead evidence and raise points both of facts and law as may be open before the respondents committee.""
  3. It, however, appears from the record that the Border Area Committee did not implement the said command of the High Court and instead allotted the suit-land to various high ranking Army Officers whose names appear in the order of the Notified Officer dated 4-9-1995 and need not be repeated here. The respondents were then allegedly pressurized, through registration of the criminal cases and otherwise into abandoning their respective claims against the said lands in question and were finally offered alternative pieces of land in Tehsil Lodhran of the then District Multan through an order, dated 13-10-1986. However, possession of the said alternative pieces of land could not be delivered to the respondents as the same was with the Forest Department.
  4. This took the respondents/their predecessors-in-interest back to the Lahore High Court where a statement was made by the learned Additional Advocate-General that the matter in question would be resolved by the Board of Revenue in pursuance of which statement the writ petitions filed by the respondents/predecessors-in-interest were disposed of on 31-5-1992. The matter/representations made by the said respondents were entrusted by the Board of Revenue to Syed Maqbool Hussain Shah the then Deputy Settlement Commissioner/Notified Officer who commenced an inquiry into the entitlement of the respondents/their predecessors-in-interest and recorded the statements of at least 14 persons including the Patwaris in the said connections. The said Notified Officer also took steps to find out whether any evacuee land was available elsewhere in the Province to settle the respondents. On the transfer of said Syed Maqbool Hussain Shah the case was entrusted to Ch. Muhammad Sarwar, Settlement Commissioner/Notified Officer through an order of the Chief Settlement Commissioner, dated 9-3-1994. The said Notified Officer continued the proceedings, examined further witnesses including a member of the Border Area Committee, perused the entire record and finally came to the conclusion through an order dated 4-9-1995 that nothing existed on record which could establish that the respondents/their predecessors-in-interest were not entitled to the allotment of lands. That the respondents had shown willingness to accept alternative pieces of land in different Districts of Province i.e. Kasur, Sialkot, Sheikhupura, Layyah, Muzaffargarh, D.G. Khan, Lahore, Multan, Bhakkar and Rawalpindi, therefore, they were finally settled on the said pieces of land.
  5. The Chief Settlement Commissioner/the Member, Board of Revenue, however, felt unhappy about the settlement and rehabilitation of these displaced persons/their successors as a result of a long struggle made by the respondents spreading over a period of more than thirty years and consequently questioned the abovementioned order of the Notified Officer dated 4-9-1995 through 18 writ petitions filed by him in the Lahore High Court. These writ petitions bearing Writ Petitions Nos.100/R to 117/R of 1999 were heard by a learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court and were dismissed through a judgment dated 13-9-2000.
  6. Hence these petitions again by the Member, Board of Revenue/Chief Settlement Commissioner, Punjab.
  7. We have heard the learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner at some length and have also perused the record.
  8. The conduct of the Chief Settlement Commissioner/M.B.R. in filing writ petitions in the High Court in the matter in question and then wasting further public time and money in approaching this Court through the present petitions is appalling.
  9. As has been mentioned above, the respondents/their predecessors-in-interest were settled in village Ghazi Kakka of District Sheikhupura after being displaced and uprooted as a result of the partitioning of the Sub-Continent. After about 15/20 years of their settlement on the said lands, the allotments made in their favour were cancelled unilaterally by the Border Area Committee without any notice or opportunity to the respondents/their predecessors-in-interest to show cause against the same. We are shocked at the conduct of the Border Area Committee which had elected not .to obey the command of the Lahore High Court made through the above-mentioned judgment dated 6-10-1979 and which Committee had instead allotted the lands in question to some Army Officers. The respondents/their predecessors-in interest appear to have been coerced into abandoning their claim vis- -vis the said lands and into accepting alternative pieces of land in a far off District of Lodhran and even those lands offered to them could not be given to them as the same were in the possession of the Forest Department which again sucked the respondents into further litigation during the course of which litigation a statement/commitment was made by a learned Additional Advocate-General that the cases of the respondents/their predecessors-in-interest would be considered by the Board of Revenue in pursuance of which statement/commitment Writ Petition No.104/R of 1992 was disposed of by the learned High Court on 31-5-1992.
  10. To say the least, it does not lie in the mouth of the Member, Board of Revenue/Chief Settlement Commissioner to say that the Notified Officer who had passed the order in question dated 4-9-1995 pursuant to the entrustment of the matter to him by the Chief Settlement Commissioner himself in pursuance of the commitment made by their representative i.e. the learned Additional Advocate-General before the Lahore High Court, had acted illegally and without jurisdiction.
  11. Secondly, the Lahore High Court, through the abovementioned order, dated 6-10-1979, had given a free hand to the Border Area Committee to re-examine the claim and the entitlement of the respondents and to cancel the allotments of land made in their favour if their claims were found fake or forged. The Border Area Committee does not claim to have found that the respondents were not entitled to the land given to them and in fact confirmed their entitlement by offering them alternative land in District Lodhran. The decision of the Chief Settlement Commissioner not to permit rehabilitation/settlement of the respondents even after more than 50 years of their displacement and to de-settle them once again, if settled, is heard to understand. As no order or findings were shown to us which could have declared the respondents as not entitled to any land, therefore, the least that the respondents deserved and the least that the State could do for them was to settle them somewhere on this earth. It was a grace shown by the respondents, either under coercion or through their free volition, that they expressed their willingness to abandon the lands where they had lived for more than 15 years and which pieces of land they had developed and improved and to have shown willingness to get scattered in different parts of the Province including far off distant areas. We are shocked that despite such a conduct on the part of the respondents, the Chief Settlement Commissioner/M.B.R. is not ready to give them a chance to exist on this planet. The above-mentioned order of the Notified Officer dated 4-9-1995 besides operating as an estoppel against the C.S.C./M.B.R., was an order which had done justice to the respondents and needless to say that the superior Courts have always refused to interfere with an action which advanced the cause of justice and which undid a manifest wrong done to a helpless and suffering party.
  12. The learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner could also offer no explanation about the inordinate delay of at least 5 years in approaching the Lahore High Court against an order dated 4-9-1995 through writ petitions filed in the year 1999.
  13. Having thus, examined all aspects of the matter, we find that the C.S.C./M.B.R. was estopped by his own conduct from questioning the order of the Notified Officer dated 4-9-1995; that the said order, dated 4-9-1995 had ensured justice to the suffering respondents; that the conduct of the Border Area Committee is not restoring the allotments of the lands in village Ghazi Kakka to the respondents in pursuance of the order of the Lahore High Court dated 6-10-1979 was contemptuous which operated at least as a factor warranting sympathy and fairplay for the respondents and that the writ petitions filed in the Lahore High Court were hit by laches. Consequently, we are of the opinion that these petitions which are calculated to prolong the agony of the respondents are without merit. The same are accordingly dismissed and leave refused.
  14. In the above noticed peculiar circumstances, the respondents who had suffered at the hands of the C.S.C./M.B.R. deserved to be compensated for the miseries caused to them. The petitioner is burdened with token costs of Rs.5,000 in each of these petitions which costs shall be paid to each of the respondents in these petitions within one month. The receipts acknowledging the said payments shall be sent to the Assistant Registrar of this Court for the information of this Bench.

  JUDGMENT
  KARAMAT NAZIR BHANDARI, J.‑‑‑ Respondent No.1 Muhammad Zakariya was allotted about 100 Kanals of land under Cooperative Farming Scheme (hereinafter to be referred as ""the scheme"") on 1‑11‑1948 by the Board of Revenue, Punjab. This land was required for extension of village Abadi and was resume. In lieu thereof, he was allotted 30 Kanals, 13 Marlas of land and Esa, father of the petitioner was also cultivating 82 Kanals, 10 Marlas of law under the same scheme He was found eligible to conferment of proprietary rights to the extent of 52 Kanals, 8 Marlas by the District Collector, Vehari vide his order, dated 24‑3‑1969. This order seems to have been accepted by the said Esa inasmuch as it was not challenged in appeal or revision. It was in the year 1987 that the said Esa applied the Collector for grant of proprietary rights in respect of remaining of land measuring 30 Kanals, 2 Marlas. This application was rejected. The Collector found that possession of Eesa on the land in excess of 52 Kanals, 8 Marlas was illegal. He, therefore, directed resumption of the land. The Additional Commissioner (Consolidation), Multan Division dismissed Esa's appeal against the order of Collector. A further revision in the Board of Revenue was also dismissed on 27‑11‑1993. This question attained finality in the revenue hierarchy. After the death of Esa, his son namely, Barkat Ali (petitioner) filed a civil suit for a declaration that he was entitled to the conferment of proprietary rights in respect of the balance of 30 Kanals, 2 Marlas. The suit was contested and was dismissed in 1988. 28 Kanals, out of the resumed land was allotted to Muhammad Zakariya, respondent No.1 in lieu of the land resumed from him. Petitioner Barkat Ali and respondent No.4 Chiragh Din filed a fresh suit challenging the allotment of land to Muhammad Zakariya, respondent No. 1. This suit was ultimately dismissed as withdrawn on 12‑4‑1990. During the pendency of the second suit, petitioner filed a review application before the Collector which was dismissed on 27‑2‑1990. The appeal was allowed by the Additional Commissioner who set aside the order of allotment in favour of Muhammad Zakariya respondent as also the order of refusing review. Muhammad Zakariya's revision was dismissed by the Board of Revenue on 27‑11‑1993. His review petition was also rejected by the Board of Revenue on 23‑10‑1994 Muhammad Zakariya, respondent No.1 challenged the orders of Additional Commissioner as well as of Board of Revenue by filing Writ Petition No.245 of 1995 in the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench which has been allowed by the learned Judge in Chambers vide judgment dated 5‑4‑2000, against which judgment the petitioner seeks leave to appeal.
  2. The extensive reproduction of facts shows that the entitlement of Esa father of the petitioner stood settled by order of Collector, dated 24‑3‑1969 which attained finality during the life time of Eesa. As noted above, the Board of Revenue dismissed his revision holding that there was nothing on the record to show that allotment of Eesa comprised of 82 Kanals, 8 Marlas and not 52 Kanals, 8 Marlas as has been held by A Collector as well as Additional Commissioner. Since the petitioner is succeeding to the estate of Eesa, he has no right to agitate the issue settled in the life time of Eesa. Filing of applications before the Revenue Officers and' also suits by the petitioners, is futile exercise and the same only indicates the extent to which a person is willing to go for grabbing land.
  3. This petition is completely devoid of merit and is hereby dismissed. Leave is refused.

  (b) Words & Phrases‑‑ ‑‑
  ‑‑ ""Policy"", ""Policy of law"" and ""public policy"" ‑‑‑Meanings.
  The word `policy' is defined as meaning a settled or definite course or method adopted by a Government, institution, body or individual.
  As applied to a rule of law, `policy' refers to its probable effect, 'tendency, or object, considered with respect to the social or political well‑being of a State.
  Policy of the law. The term is difficult to define. It has been considered to refer to the purpose and spirit of the substantive laws of a State, whether such laws be found in the Constitution and statutes or in judicial records. The term has been said to be synonymous with public policy.
  The term public policy is perhaps the most expansive and widely comprehensive phrase known to the law. It has been said that the doctrine of public policy originated in England in the early part of the Fifteenth Century, and that the principle of public policy owes its existence to the very sources from which the common law is supplied. The phrase is used in several senses, and it may mean the prevalent notions of justice and general fundamental conceptions of right and wrong and it may mean both. It is, a vague, indefinite, and nebulous term.
  It is evident that public policy is a relative term and sometime lacks in precision and oftenly is used indistinctly and there must be pragmatic approach for understanding its real meaning to the light of the circumstances surrounding the, particular transaction. When a policy or direction is given for guidance to the officers of a department without any statutory backing, no claim of vested right can be based on such policy or direction.

  (d) Possession‑‑‑
  ‑‑‑‑ Concept‑‑‑Juristical point of view‑‑‑"" Mediate possession"" and ""immediate possession"" ‑‑‑Distinction illustrated.
  Possession originally expresses the simple notion of a physical capacity to deal with a thing as we like to the exclusion of every one else. The primary and main object of ownership is the protection of this physical capacity. If this physical condition had alone to be considered all that could be said upon possession from juristical point of view would be contained in the following sentences:‑
  The owner of a thing has the right to possess it. Every one has the same right to whom the owner has given the possession. No one else has that right of possession.
  The legal notion of possession however is not confined to this simple physical condition. Possession is treated in law, not only as a physical condition which is protected by ownership but as a right in itself. From possession under certain conditions, important legal consequences are derived; in advanced systems of law the right of possession is frequently separated from the right of ownership. Moreover, the possession with which the law thus deals is not that simple physical condition described above, and to which for the sake of distinction, we may give the name of Detention. It is true that the physical element is never altogether lost sight of; on the contrary, a physical element of some kind or other, is essentially necessary to possession in its widest legal sense.
  Upon analysis, therefore, the idea of possession resolves itself into two elements; physical and mental corpus and animus: Possession in any sense of the term must imply, first, some actual power over the object possessed and secondly, some amount of will to avail oneself of that power. The mind must accompany the act, the will must realize or embody itself in an external fact or group of facts.
  In law one person may possess a thing for and on account of someone else. In such a case the latter is in possession by the agency 'of him who so holds the thing on his behalf. The possession thus held by one man through another may be termed mediate, while that which is acquired or retained directly or personally may be distinguished as immediate or direct. If I go myself to purchase a book, I acquire direct possession of it; but if I send my servant to buy it for me, I acquire mediate possession of it through him, until he has brought it to me when my possession becomes immediate.
  Of mediate possession there are three kinds. The first is that which I acquire through an agent or servant; that is to say, through someone who holds solely on my account and claims no interest of his own. In such a case I undoubtedly acquire or retain possession; as, for example, when I allow my servant to use my tools in his work, or when I send him to buy or borrow a chattel for me, or when I deposit goods with a warehouseman who holds them on my account, or when I send my boots to a shoemaker to be repaired. In all such cases, though the immediate possession is in the servant, warehouseman, or artisan, the mediate possession is in me; for the immediate possession is held on my account. The second kind of mediate possession is that in which the direct possession is in one who holds both on my account and on his own, but who recognizes my superior right to obtain from him the direct possession whenever I choose to demand it. That is to say, it is the case of a borrower or tenant‑at‑will. I do not lose possession of a thing because I have lent it to someone who acknowledges my title to it and is prepared to return it to me on demand, and who in the meantime holds it and looks after it on my behalf. There is no difference in this respect between entrusting a thing to a servant or agent and entrusting it to a borrower. Through the one, as well as through the other, I retain as regards all other persons a due security for the use and enjoyment of my property. I myself possess whatever is possessed for me on those terms by another.
  There is yet a third form of mediate possession, respecting which more doubt may exist, but which must be recognized by sound theory as true possession. It is the case in which the immediate possession is in a person who claims it for himself until some time has elapsed or some condition has been fulfilled, but who acknowledges the title of another for whom he holds the thing, and to whom he is prepared to deliver it when his own temporary claim has come to an end: as for example when I lend a chattel to another for a fixed time, or deliver it as a pledge to be returned on the payment of a debt. Even in such .a case I retain possession of the thing, so far as third persons are concerned.
  Possession itself is not equated to that of legal right on the basis whereof ownership could be claimed.

  The word `policy' is defined as meaning a settled or definite course or method adopted by a Government, institution, body or individual.
  As applied to a rule of law, `policy' refers to its probable effect, 'tendency, or object, considered with respect to the social or political well‑being of a State.
  Policy of the law. The term is difficult to define. It has been considered to refer to the purpose and spirit of the substantive laws of a State, whether such laws be found in the Constitution and statutes or in judicial records. The term has been said to be synonymous with public policy.
  The term public policy is perhaps the most expansive and widely comprehensive phrase known to the law. It has been said that the doctrine of public policy originated in England in the early part of the Fifteenth Century, and that the principle of public policy owes its existence to the very sources from which the common law is supplied. The phrase is used in several senses, and it may mean the prevalent notions of justice and general fundamental conceptions of right and wrong and it may mean both. It is, a vague, indefinite, and nebulous term.
  It is evident that public policy is a relative term and sometime lacks in precision and oftenly is used indistinctly and there must be pragmatic approach for understanding its real meaning to the light of the circumstances surrounding the, particular transaction. When a policy or direction is given for guidance to the officers of a department without any statutory backing, no claim of vested right can be based on such policy or direction.

  (d) Possession‑‑‑
  ‑‑‑‑ Concept‑‑‑Juristical point of view‑‑‑"" Mediate possession"" and ""immediate possession"" ‑‑‑Distinction illustrated.
  Possession originally expresses the simple notion of a physical capacity to deal with a thing as we like to the exclusion of every one else. The primary and main object of ownership is the protection of this physical capacity. If this physical condition had alone to be considered all that could be said upon possession from juristical point of view would be contained in the following sentences:‑
  The owner of a thing has the right to possess it. Every one has the same right to whom the owner has given the possession. No one else has that right of possession.
  The legal notion of possession however is not confined to this simple physical condition. Possession is treated in law, not only as a physical condition which is protected by ownership but as a right in itself. From possession under certain conditions, important legal consequences are derived; in advanced systems of law the right of possession is frequently separated from the right of ownership. Moreover, the possession with which the law thus deals is not that simple physical condition described above, and to which for the sake of distinction, we may give the name of Detention. It is true that the physical element is never altogether lost sight of; on the contrary, a physical element of some kind or other, is essentially necessary to possession in its widest legal sense.
  Upon analysis, therefore, the idea of possession resolves itself into two elements; physical and mental corpus and animus: Possession in any sense of the term must imply, first, some actual power over the object possessed and secondly, some amount of will to avail oneself of that power. The mind must accompany the act, the will must realize or embody itself in an external fact or group of facts.
  In law one person may possess a thing for and on account of someone else. In such a case the latter is in possession by the agency 'of him who so holds the thing on his behalf. The possession thus held by one man through another may be termed mediate, while that which is acquired or retained directly or personally may be distinguished as immediate or direct. If I go myself to purchase a book, I acquire direct possession of it; but if I send my servant to buy it for me, I acquire mediate possession of it through him, until he has brought it to me when my possession becomes immediate.
  Of mediate possession there are three kinds. The first is that which I acquire through an agent or servant; that is to say, through someone who holds solely on my account and claims no interest of his own. In such a case I undoubtedly acquire or retain possession; as, for example, when I allow my servant to use my tools in his work, or when I send him to buy or borrow a chattel for me, or when I deposit goods with a warehouseman who holds them on my account, or when I send my boots to a shoemaker to be repaired. In all such cases, though the immediate possession is in the servant, warehouseman, or artisan, the mediate possession is in me; for the immediate possession is held on my account. The second kind of mediate possession is that in which the direct possession is in one who holds both on my account and on his own, but who recognizes my superior right to obtain from him the direct possession whenever I choose to demand it. That is to say, it is the case of a borrower or tenant‑at‑will. I do not lose possession of a thing because I have lent it to someone who acknowledges my title to it and is prepared to return it to me on demand, and who in the meantime holds it and looks after it on my behalf. There is no difference in this respect between entrusting a thing to a servant or agent and entrusting it to a borrower. Through the one, as well as through the other, I retain as regards all other persons a due security for the use and enjoyment of my property. I myself possess whatever is possessed for me on those terms by another.
  There is yet a third form of mediate possession, respecting which more doubt may exist, but which must be recognized by sound theory as true possession. It is the case in which the immediate possession is in a person who claims it for himself until some time has elapsed or some condition has been fulfilled, but who acknowledges the title of another for whom he holds the thing, and to whom he is prepared to deliver it when his own temporary claim has come to an end: as for example when I lend a chattel to another for a fixed time, or deliver it as a pledge to be returned on the payment of a debt. Even in such .a case I retain possession of the thing, so far as third persons are concerned.
  Possession itself is not equated to that of legal right on the basis whereof ownership could be claimed.

  Date of hearing: 13th May, 2004.
  JUDGMENT
  JAVED IQBAL, J.‑‑‑--This appeal with leave of the Court is directed against the judgment dated 18‑3‑1996 passed by learned High Court of Balochistan whereby writ petition preferred on behalf of respondents has been accepted and the order, dated 23‑2‑1995 passed by learned Senior Member, Board of Revenue, Balochistan, has been set aside being illegal and transfer order, dated 15‑7‑1991 regarding plot in question in favour of respondents has been kept intact.
  2. The leave granting order dated 24‑9‑1998 is reproduced herein below to appreciate the legal and actual aspects of the controversy:‑‑
  ""After hearing the learned counsel for both sides at length, we are inclined to grant leave to appeal in this case to consider the following crucial questions to determine the rights of the parties in respect of the disputed property:‑‑
  (1) What is the effect of MLO 16 on the legal character of the lease in favour of the respondents assuming that it had done away with the leasehold rights of the respondents, then in the said event, the further grant of lease or sale of this right was to be determined according to the new policy?
  (2) What is the legal character of the new policy framed to govern such leases/sales? If it is held that the MLO had in fact abolished the leasehold rights of the respondents; then were they entitled to purchase this land from the Government of Balochistan though not being in occupation of the property?
  (3)One of the consequences of MLO was that the authorities had framed a new policy under which only the occupants; who were in physical possession, were entitled to the lease or sale. That being so, had not a valuable right accrued in favour of the petitioners to claim the lease or sale of the disputed property, being in actual physical possession on the basis of the aforesaid policy?
  (4) Initially, the disputed land vested in the Municipal Corporation Quetta but subsequently, it became property of the Provincial Government, which sold the same in favour of the respondents. Prima facie, the sale being in violation of the policy framed, could not have deprived the petitioners to claim its purchase being in physical possession.
Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted to consider, inter alia, the above questions.""
  3. This case has got a chequered history. The respondents filed Constitutional petition whereby order, dated 5‑7‑1992 passed by the Senior Member, Board of Revenue, canceling the order dated 15‑7‑1991 whereby a plot measuring 600 sq. ft located at the berm of Habib Nala Mission Road, Quetta, was sold to the respondents at the rate of Rs.2,500 per sq. ft. at the total cost of 15,00,000 on the representation dated 16‑12‑1991 made by Ghiasuddin (appellant) being an occupant of the plot in question: The case was remanded by means of order, dated 15‑3‑1993 to the Member, Board of Revenue to decide the controversy in accordance with law and observations, made therein. The‑ order, dated 15‑3‑1993 was challenged by both the parties being dissatisfied by means of civil petitions for leave to Appeal bearing Nos.30‑Q and 31‑Q of 1993 before this Court which were rejected by the Court on 9‑9‑1993 with the following observations:‑‑
  ""We have heard at length Mr. Basharatullah and Mr. Aslam Chishti learned counsel for the parties and we are inclined to agree with the High Court that the case involved disputed questions of fact, which inter alia include the question as to who was in possession of the land, who raised the construction thereon, in what capacity the petitioners in the second petition occupied the land with the structure thereon. The above questions cannot be resolved in exercise of Constitutional jurisdiction. The same are pre‑eminently suitable to be adjudicated upon by respondent No.1. Leave is accordingly refused.""
  Purusant to remand order, dated 15‑3‑1993, the learned Member Board of Revenue proceeded with the matter and directed the parties to produce evidence. Another controversy cropped up qua the manner in which the parties were required to produce their evidence. No evidence whatsoever was led by the parties to substantiate their claims. In view of the judgment of this Court dated 9‑9‑1993, the case was transferred to learned Senior Member, Board of. Revenue who vide order, dated 7‑2‑1994, directed the parties to file written arguments by 5‑3‑1994. However, on 23‑2‑1995 the transfer of plot which was sold to respondents was cancelled. The order, dated 15‑7‑1991 was challenged by way of Writ Petition bearing No.93 of 1995 which has been accepted, hence this appeal.
  4. Mr. Fakharuddin G. Ebrahim, learned Advocate Supreme Court appeared on behalf of appellants and urged vehemently that the legal and factual aspects of the controversy have not been appreciated in its true perspective, which resulted in serious miscarriage of justice. It is next contended that the shop in question was a part of Regularization Policy which could not have been excluded from its domain and exclusion whereof by the High Court is based on conjectural presumptions having no value in the eye of law and on this score alone the judgment impugned is liable to be set aside. It is also argued that the judgment impugned is in contradiction of the earlier order, dated 5-3‑1993 whereby the case was remanded and the teamed High Court opined that the Regularization Policy was not applicable to the plot in question then what was the necessity and justification to pass the remand order. It is urged with vehemence that the word ""him"" as used in para. 5(c) of the Regularization Policy has been misconstrued and misinterpreted and the learned High Court erred while holding that the word ""him"" refers to the respondent (Ghulam Mohyuddin) and not the appellant (Ghiasuddin). It is also argued that the Regularization Policy was notified by the Board of Revenue vide Notification No.125‑8/91‑Rev. on 4‑6‑1992 wherein para. 5(c) and para. 6 of the Policy were not mentioned of the simple reason that only the salient features of the Regularization Policy were enumerated in the Notification. It is pointed out that even for the sake of arguments, if it is admitted that para. 5(c) and para. 6 .of the Regularization Policy were not incorporated in the said Notification, it would not amount to the non‑existence of para. 5(c) and para. 6 of the Regularization Policy which was formulated and approved by the competent authority on 18‑6‑1991. It is further pointed out that the Policy was approved on 18‑6‑1991. and regularization of the plot in favour of respondents was made on 15‑7‑1991. It is contended that the real nature of dispute could not be appreciated by the learned High Court as the entire controversy revolved around the allotment of shop situated on the Government land under the Regularization Policy, dated 18‑6‑1991 on the basis of occupation and the previous round of litigation specially the proceedings conducted in 1954 to decide the question of occupation in favour of the respondents should have not been relied upon and considered as has been done by the learned High Court. It is argued with vehemence that after resumption of shop in question under MLO No. 16/46 on 11‑5‑1985, the question of ownership was buried forever having no legal consequences whatsoever. Besides that it is pointed out that, the respondents admitted before the High Court regarding the occupation on the disputed shop since 1954. In this regard para. 7 of the memo. of petition preferred on behalf of respondents has been referred. It is next contended that conclusion of the learned High Court regarding occupation of the shop by the appellants due to their induction by the respondents has no nexus whatsoever with the evidence which has come on record. It is argued that remand order passed by the High Court is demonstrative of the fact that sufficient material was lacking to draw any conclusion, which has been drawn subsequently without advancing any cogent or concrete reason. According to Mr. Fakharuddin G. Ebrahim, learned Advocate Supreme Court, the only appropriate course for the High Court was to dismiss the petition as no relief could have been granted.
  5. Mr. Basharatullah, learned Senior Advocate. Supreme Court appeared on behalf of respondents and supported the judgment impugned for the reasons enumerated therein with further submissions that the plot .in question was auctioned in their favour in the year 1959 when the appellants were never in the field. It is pointed out that the shop was constructed on the plot in question by the respondents pursuant to permission granted by Municipal Engineer. Quetta Municipality by means of Building Permit No.3416‑B., dated 9‑7‑1952. It is also pointed out, by. Mr. Basharatullah, learned Advocate Supreme Court on behalf of respondents that a dispute accrued regarding construction of shop on the plot in question between the Quetta Municipality and that of respondents which was decided in their favour by learned subordinate Judge, Quetta on 29‑9‑1955 (Civil Suit No.187/54) and the appeal filed by the Quetta Municipal Committee was also dismissed by the learned District Judge, Quetta vide judgment, dated 12‑12‑1995. which is indicative of the fact that the ownership of the shop constructed on the plot in question pertained to then respondents. It is argued that the lease deed was executed in favour of respondents on 30‑6‑1976 between the Collector, Quetta and the respondents whereby the plot in question was leased out in favour of respondents for a period of 99 years at the rate of Rs.5 per 100 sq. ft. per annum. The lease deed was commenced w.e.f. 13‑11‑1995 and construction was already completed in 1954. It is pointed out that the confusion if any was clarified by the learned Member‑11, Board of Revenue, Balochistan vide. order, dated 7‑5‑1975. It is admitted by Mr. Basharatullah, learned Advocate Supreme Court on behalf of respondents that the plot in question was resumed under M. L. O. No. 16 but subsequently, it was sold to respondents by means of Order bearing No.125‑8191‑Rev. By order of the Member Board of Revenue, Balochistan at the cost of Rs.2500 per sq. ft. and total sum of Rs.15,00,000 was deposited by respondents and consequently mutation was restored in their favour on 17‑12‑1991. Mr. Basharatullah, learned Advocate Supreme Court on behalf of respondents has contended with vehemence that the Member Board of Revenue has no authority to cancel the plot in question and transfer the same along with structure as ownership of the plot in question was devolved upon the respondents after having purchased the plot in question against the consideration of Rs.15,00,000. In order to substantiate his esteemed views, the learned Advocate Supreme Court on behalf of respondents has placed reliance on the case of ""Madrissa Darul Uloom v. Additional District. Judge PLD 1992 SC 401.
  6. We have carefully examined the respective contentions as agitated on behalf of the parties in the light of relevant provisions of law and record of the case. We have scanned the entire evidence with the eminent assistance of the learned counsel. We have also perused the judgment passed by learned Senior Member, Board of Revenue as well as judgment impugned. After having gone through the entire record, it appears that the claim of appellants mainly hinges in the policy formulated by the Government of Balochistan in this regard. Let we mention here at this juncture that formulation of the policy and its approval as highlighted comprehensively by Mr. Fakharuddin G. Ebrahim. learned Advocate Supreme Court on behalf of appellants would have no material bearing on the fate of case. The important question would be as to whether the Policy relied upon has been implemented in toto and if so, on which specific date. The implementation of such Policy could only be made by means of notification, which was admittedly issued on 4‑6‑1992 concerning disposal of the Government property located at the berm of Habib Nala, Mission Road, Quetta. The salient features of the policy formulated on 13‑4‑1991 are as under:‑‑‑
  ""(4) While recommending regularization following principles have been adopted.
  (a)that not more than one shop is regularized in favour of a person. (A fresh survey has been conducted with the help of the D.C. to ascertain the present occupants);
  (b) regularization should be in favour of the occupants;
  (c)although the encroachment has continued for several decades and rent should also have been charged, only the prevailing market price may be charged;
  (d) the price assessed for regularization should approximately to the prevailing market price as ascertained on the basis of 3 years average of transactions; and
  (e)the price will be charged in lump sum and will be payable within 120 days from the date of its receipt by the occupant;
  (f) in case someone fails to make the payment within the given time the offer of regularization will be cancelled and orders issued for removal of encroachment. For as long as encroachment remains in place he shall be liable to pay a monthly rent of Rs.15 per Sq. ft.
  (5) Progressive price sale may be adopted so as to hold little guy e.g.
  (a) 80 shops at Khushi Ram Road
  (i) 17 plots upto 100 sq. ft. Rs.250 per sq. ft.
  (ii) 40 plots from 101 to 150 Rs.300 per sq. ft.
  (iii) 14 plots from 151 to 290 Rs.350 per sq. ft.
  (iv) 4 plots from 201 onward Rs.400 per sq. ft.
  (b) 8 shops at Mission Road
  (i) for plots up to 100 sq. ft. Rs.1500.per sq. ft.
  (ii) for plots from 101 to 200 sq. ft. Rs.1600 per sq. ft.
  (iii) for plots from 200 sq. ft. Rs.2000 per square ft. and above.
  (c)the only remaining shop not covered under (a) and (b) of this para. is that of one Qudussi General Store. Since this shop is situated in a busy commercial area, it commands much higher price. It may, therefore, be transferred to him at Rs.2500 per sq. ft.
  (6) It is suggested that the transfer pf land to the present occupants as per list, dated 7‑4‑1991 (F/D) signed by Tehsildar, Quetta and forwarded by D.C. Quetta may be regularized.

Dated 11‑4‑1991.""
  The above mentioned Policy was implemented by means of Notification No.125‑8/91‑Rev. dated 4‑6‑1992 by the Board oaf Revenue, which is demonstrative of the fact that the shop in question was not included in it and hence the question of its transfer to the ""occupant"" (appellants) does not arise. Had this been the intention of the Board of Revenue, there would have been no justification to use the word ""him"" and the word ""occupant"" could have been used very conveniently as it was used for 80 shops. located at Khushi Ram Road, Quetta, and 8 shops at Mission Road, Quetta. It. was made abundant clear in para. 5(c) of the Policy that it would not be applicable to Qudussi General Store i.e. the: property to dispute. Even for the sake of arguments if it is admitted that the summary to get the Regularization Policy approved was prepared on 13‑4‑1991 but how it could be made applicable with retrospective effect as admittedly it was enforced on 4‑6‑1992 by means of Notification No. 125‑8/91‑Rev., dated 4‑6‑1992 whereas the property in dispute was already transferred to respondents on 15‑7‑1991. Mr. Fakharuddin G. Ebrahim, learned. Advocate Supreme Court on behalf of appellants could not furnish satisfactory explanation that as to how retrospective effect could be given to the Policy which was admittedly notified on 4‑6‑1992. Besides that the Member Board of Revenue had conceded in the earlier round of litigation' in his counter‑affidavit that the Notification, dated 4‑6‑1992 was not applicable qua the property in dispute. How a contradictory stance that too without any legal foundation can be taken now? The Policy itself had no legal sanctity prior to the issuance of the notification, dated 4‑6‑1992 through which it was got enforced excluding the property in question. It would be an exercise in p futility to examine as to whether the property in question was included in the policy or otherwise because we are mainly concerned with the part of Policy which was enforced by means of Notification, dated 4-6‑1992.
  The policy in fact is a mechanism evolved to face, check and resolve a particular situation whereas the notification is an instrument through which it is enforced. It is for the competent authority to choose as to which part of the Policy or entire policy by excluding certain principles incorporated therein, is required to be implemented and the discretion so exercised cannot be questioned. We may make it clear that ""policy"" and ""notification"" are not interchangeable or synonymoyus terms having its own peculiar characteristic, import and significance. The expression ""policy"", ""policy of law"" and ""public policy"" have been described in Corpus Juris. Secundum by Francis, J. Ludes, Volume LXXII as follows:‑‑
  ""Policy. The word 'policy' is defined as meaning a settled or definite course or method adopted by a Government, institution, body or individual.
  As applied to a rule of law, 'policy' refers to its probable effect, tendency, or object, considered with respect to the social or political well‑being of a State.""
  ""Policy of the law. The term is difficult to define. It has been considered to refer to the purpose and spirit of the substantive laws of a State, whether such laws be found in the Constitution and statutes or in judicial records. The term has been said to be synonymous with public policy.""
  ""Public Policy. The term public policy is perhaps the most expansive and widely comprehensive phrase known to the law. It has been said that the doctrine of public policy originated in England in the early part of the Fifteenth Century, arid that the principle of public policy owes its existence to the very sources from which the common law is supplied. The phrase is used in several senses; and it may mean the prevalent notions of justice and general fundamental conceptions of right and wrong and it may mean both. It is a vague, indefinite, and nebulous term. ""
  ""It is evident that public policy is a relative term and sometime lacks in precision and oftenly is used indistinctly and there must be pragmatic approach for understanding its real meaning in the light of the circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. When a policy or direction is given for guidance to the officers of a department without any statutory backing, no claim of vested right can be based on such policy or direction."" Shafiq Ahmed v. Federation of Pakistan 1997 CLC 697. The Regularization Policy has been discussed in view of what has been stated above and we are of the opinion that no legal right whatsoever was conferred upon the appellants by virtue of the Regularization Policy reproduced in the preceding paragraph to retain the shop in question for an indefinite period on account of occupation or physical possession.
  7. It also transpired from scrutiny of record that the case of appellants mainly hinges upon representation made by them on 16‑12‑1991 that the property in question be transferred to them being occupants in oblivion of the fact that they were occupants of the property, ownership whereof was never vested in the Government, hence the question of its transfer does not arise because it was not available property which could have been transferred to the appellants merely on the basis of representation and without showing any legal right. A line of distinction is to be drawn between encroachers who constructed shops on the berm of Habib Nala, Mission Road, Quetta and made hectic efforts to convert their unlawful possession to that of law and the appellants who were admittedly not encroachers and occupying the shop constructed on the plot in question which pertained to respondents hence no benefit could be elicited from the Regularization Policy formulated by the Government as reproduced above excluding the Qudussi General Store i.e. the disputed property, from its operation. No evidence worth the name could be produced by the appellants to substantiate their claim. The policy even otherwise cannot be invoked as it was formulated for a group of encroachers and the appellants does not fall within that category. For all the practical purposes, the appellants emerged on the scene on 16‑12‑1991 when at first occasion, an application was moved for the transfer of property in question. On the other hand, the respondents were in possession of the plot in question since 1951 on D which the shop was constructed, which is also supported by the judgment, dated 29‑9‑1955 whereby it was held that the construction was made in accordance with the Municipal Code of Building and the Quetta Municipal. Committee had no right to demolish it. It is worth‑mentioning that the said judgment was upheld by the District Judge on 12‑12‑1955. It is to be noted that the registered lease deed dated 30‑1‑1976 was also executed between the Collector, Quetta and the respondents and no claim or objection whatsoever was made by the appellants regarding execution of lease deed between the Collector, Quetta and the respondents for 99 years. The appellants woke up from a deep slumber after about four decades probably due to alarming increase in the potential value of the land and exorbitant rise in the market price but it was too late to launch such a campaign on hypertechnical grounds and wishful thinking. The appellants had absolutely no locus standi to claim, for the transfer of plot in question which was already transferred in favour of respondents on 15‑7‑1991 in lieu of Rs.5,00,000 duly received by the Member Board of Revenue on behalf of Government. The appellants have failed miserably to substantiate their claim by adducing any worthy of credence oral /documentary evidence. No legal right was ever accrued in favour of appellants and hence the question of its infringement does not arise. How the legal rights accrued in favour of respondents could be extinguished merely on the ground that the land was resumed under M. L. O. No. 16 and even such resumption does not confer any right upon the appellants, who have no leg to stand. The cancellation of plot in question under M.L.O. No.16 would not confer automatically the right of transfer or ownership of the plot in question upon the appellants. Nothing contrary has come on record to show that the plot in question was never auctioned and purchased by late Haji Ali Bahadur (father of respondents Nos.1‑3) who was called upon on 18‑6‑1992 by the Municipal Committee, Quetta to make the payment of Municipal Fee and needful was done on 21‑6‑1952. At first instance the plot in question was leased out to the respondents for a period of thirty years and registered lease deed was executed on 13‑5‑1954. The plan for construction was got sanctioned by the Municipal Committee, Quetta and the shop was constructed having Municipal No.7‑18/129 by the appellants. The relevant municipal record, such as, demarcation, dated 19‑8‑1954 and cards regarding completion of different phases of the construction between 20‑8‑1954 to 22‑9‑1954 lend full support to the claim of appellants who had been admittedly making payment of the ground rent and the conservancy tax etc.
  8. In view of what has been stated above, it can be inferred safely that the word ""him"" as used in the summary was surely meant for the respondent (Ghulam Mohyuddin). No doubt that the plot in question was cancelled pursuant to M.L.O. No. 16 but at this belated stage it would be of no use to discuss the question as to whether the plot in question could have been cancelled under M.L.O. No. 16 or otherwise in view of the subsequent developments which resulted in the sale of plot in question to the respondents by the Member, Board of Revenue vide order, dated 15‑7‑1991 in a sum of Rs.15,00,000 and after its payment the plot in question was mutated in favour of the respondents on 17‑12‑991 by means of mutation entry. After the said transaction the plea that the plot in question was resumed pursuant to M.L.O. No.16 would have no substantial bearing on merits of the case as it hardly render any assistance to the case of appellants. It is worth‑mentioning that as per order of the Member Board of Revenue, offer was given to the respondents to purchase the plot in question at the prevailing market rate of Rs.25 per sq. ft. The Martial Law Administrator had accepted the appeal of the respondents by means of Order No.0301/16(Legal), dated 18‑5‑1978 pursuant to which the respondents accepted the offer made by the Member Board of Revenue to purchase the plot in question at the rate of Rs.25 per sq‑ ft. The respondents were allowed to purchase the plot against payment of Rs.16,800 which was deposited in the State Bank of Pakistan on 5‑8‑1978 and the plot in question was mutated in favour of respondents vide Mutation No.767 which was got attested on 12‑9‑1978.
  9. Mr. Fakharuddin G. Ebrahim. learned Advocate Supreme Court on behalf of appellants has stressed time and again that the shop in question was in the possession/occupation of respondents by ignoring the fact that merely possession or occupation do not constitute a legal right to retain the possession or occupation of the shop in question for an indefinite period. The possession of respondents was nothing more but physical occupation without any legal basis. There is no cavil with the proposition that ""possession originally expresses the simple notion of a physical capacity to deal with a thing as we like to the exclusion of every one else. The primary and main object of ownership is the protection of this physical capacity and as pointed out by Savigny, if this physical condition had alone to be considered all that could be said upon possession from juristical point of view would be contained in the following sentences:‑‑‑
  `The owner of a thing has the right to possess it. Every one has the same right to whom the owner has given the possession. No one else has that right of possession.'
  ""The legal notion of possession however is not confined to this simple physical condition. Possession is treated in law, not only as a physical condition which is protected by ownership but as a right in itself. From possession under certain conditions, important legal consequences are derived; in advanced systems of law the right of possession is frequently separated from the right of ownership. Moreover, the possession with which the law thus deals is not that simple physical condition described above, and to which for the sake of distinction, .we may give the name of Detention. It is true that the physical element is never altogether lost sight of; on the contrary, a physical element of some kind or other, is essentially necessary to possession in its widest legal sense.""
  The learned author has further analysed the concept of possession and observed as follows:‑‑
  ""Upon analysis, therefore, the idea of possession resolves itself into two elements; physical and mental‑ corpus and animus, Possession in any sense of the term must imply, first, some F actual power over the object possessed and secondly, some amount of will to avail oneself of that power. The mind must accompany the act, the will must realize or embody itself in an external fact or group of facts.""
  The books also distinguish between possession in fact and possession in law. Another division of the concept of possession is between mediate possession and immediate possession. This has been explained lucidly in Salmond on Jurisprudence (supra) as under:‑‑‑
  ""In law one person may possess a thing for and on account of someone else. In such a case the latter is in possession by the agency of him who so holds the thing on his behalf. The possession thus held by one man through another may be termed mediate, while that which is acquired or retained directly or personally may be distinguished as immediate or direct. If I go myself to purchase a book, I acquire direct possession of it; but if I send my servant to buy it for me, I acquire mediate possession of it through him, until he has brought it to me when my possession becomes immediate.
  Of mediate possession there are three kinds. The first is that which I acquire through an agent or servant; that is to say, through someone who holds solely on my account and claims no interest of his own. In such a case I undoubtedly acquire or retain possession; as, for example, when I allow my servant to use my tools in his work, or when I send him to buy or borrow a chattel for me, or when I. deposit goods with a warehouseman who holds them on my account, or when I send my boots to a shoemaker to be repaired. In all such cases, though the immediate possession is in the servant, warehouseman, or artisan, the mediate possession is in me; for the immediate possession is held on my account. The second kind of mediate possession is that in which the direct possession is in one who holds both on my account and on his own, but who recognizes my superior right to obtain from him the direct possession whenever 1 choose to demand it. That is to say, it is the case of a borrower or tenant‑at‑will. I do not lose possession of a thing because I have lent it to someone who acknowledges my title to it and is prepared to return it to me on demand, and who in the meantime holds it and looks after it on my behalf. There is no difference in this respect between entrusting a thing to a servant or agent and entrusting it to a borrower. Through the one, as well as through the other, I retain as regards all other persons a due security for the use and enjoyment of my property. I myself possess whatever is possessed for me on those terms by another.
  There is yet a third form of mediate possession, respecting which more doubt may exist, but which must be recognized by sound theory as true possession. It is the case in which the immediate possession is in a person who claims it for himself until some time has elapsed or some condition has been fulfilled, but who acknowledges the title of another for whom he holds the thing, and to whom he is prepared to deliver it when his own temporary claim has come to an end; as for example when I lend a chattel to another for a fixed time, or deliver it as a pledge to be returned on the payment of a debt. Even in such a case I retain possession of the thing, so far as third persons are concerned."" Muhammad Rifatullah Alvi v. Imran Ansari PLD 1990 SC 369.
  The above analysis qua the concept of possession would indicate that the possession itself is not equated to that of legal right on the basis whereof ownership could be claimed. As discussed hereinabove, sufficient evidence has come on record, on the basis whereof it could be inferred safely that the plot in question was leased out sold in favour of respondents by whom the shop in question was constructed which cannot be retained by the appellants merely on the ground that once upon a, time, a representation was made by them to allot the plot in question ins their favour which could not be finalized.
  10. It is amazing that during more than three decades the appellants were never remained in picture when the plot in question was either sold or leased out to the respondents who alone have been fighting to get the plot in question transferred in their favour. The appellants have failed miserably to substantiate their claim by producing any evidence. The judgment impugned being well‑based does not warrant interference. The appeal being meritless is dismissed. The parties are left to bear their own costs.

  JUDGMENT
  MUHAMMAD NAWAZ ABBASI, J.‑‑‑ The petitioners seek leave to appeal against the judgment dated 27‑6‑2001 passed by a learned Single Judge of Lahore High Court, Bahawalpur Bench, in regular Second Appeal arising out of a civil suit.
  2. The relevant facts in the background are that late Muhammad [)in, father of Mst. Khurshid Bibi (mother of petitioners) and brother of Muhammad Ibrahim, respondent herein, was allotted land measuring 100 Kanals in the area of Fort Abbas, under Colonization of Government lands (Punjab) Act, 1912. Mst. Khurshid Bibi and Muhammad Ibrahim. being the sole legal heirs of Muhammad Din on his death, succeeded him equal shares in the suit‑land and accordingly, the mutation of inheritance dated 1‑4‑1978 to the extent of 1/2 share of each of them was sanctioned. Subsequently, Mst. Khurshid Bibi died and the petitioners being her successor‑in‑interest, .filed a suit for declaration that Mst. Khurshid Bibi was full owner of the land and Muhammad Ibrahim was not entitled to inherit the suit property. The suit was contested by Muhammad Ibrahim, respondent, on various grounds and the learned trial Judge in the light of pleadings of the parties, framed issues and ultimately dismissed the suit vide judgment and decree dated 29‑7‑1979. The appeal preferred by the petitioners in the Lahore High Court at Bahawalpur Bench, was dismissed vide impugned judgment.
  3. The main contention, amongst others, of the petitioners before the High Court in Regular Second Appeal was that sections 30 and 30‑A of Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 were not considered and given effect. The High Court observed in the matter, as under:‑‑
  ""The effect of section 30‑A of the Act, 1912 shall be that any estate held by a female under section 30‑A will be in reality limited estate so as to attract provisions of section 3 of Act (V of 1962). On termination of such estate Mst. Khurshid Bib'. shall be entitled to hold only her share under Muslim Law of Inheritance. Reliance placed on Mst. Began v. Mst. Bai 1983 SCMR 80.""
  4. The land measuring 10 Kanals allotted to Muhammad Din, under Colonization of Government Land (Punjab) Act, 1912 was mutated on 21‑5‑1962 in the name of his unmarried daughter, Mst. Khurshid Bibi as limited owner till she would be married and since Muhammad Din had no other legal heir, except Muhammad Ibrahim, real brother and Mst. Khurshid Bibi daughter, therefore, on the opening of his succession Mst. Khurshid Bibi and Muhammad Ibrahim would inherit the land in question, in terms of section 19‑A of Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 and both would get 1/2 share in the land under West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962. This Court in Mst. Began v. Mst. Bai 1983 SCMR 80, held as under:‑‑
  ""that the estate held under section 30‑A(1) by a female is in reality a limited estate held under custom. That being so, the provisions of section 3 of West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962 would be attracted. The limited estate held by Mst. Bai, as found above, was governed by the said law. It having been terminated, she was entitled to hold only her share under Muslim Law of Inheritance. Sadoo having died issueless, she was given 1/4th share. Therefore, as she could not be given more than that, her suit merited dismissal.
Accordingly, while setting aside the impugned judgment and decree, the suit of Mst. Bai is dismissed.""
  5. Under section 21(b) of the (ibid) Act, a tenant of the land would be deemed to have acquired proprietary rights and in case of a Muslim tenant, his succession would be governed by Muslim Personal Law (Shariat Application) Act, 1962. The combined effect of the above A provision of law, would be that on termination of limited interest, the succession would open and the legal heirs of a Muslim tenant would inherit property under West Pakistan Muslim Person Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962.
  6. Learned counsel for the petitioners has contended that mutation of inheritance was sanctioned in the name of Mst. Khurshid Bibi in the year 1962 whereas the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 was made applicable in the District Bahawalpur w.e.f. 4th March, 1951, vide Notification/memo. No. 7099‑60/8456‑C‑VIII, dated 27‑12‑1960 issued by Board of Revenue, Government of West Pakistan and this being so, the allotment in question would be out of the purview of Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912, therefore, it would not be subject to West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law Shariat) Application Act, 1962 and consequently, Mst. Khurshid Bibi would become exclusive owner of the property on death of Muhammad Din. We are afraid, there is nothing on record to suggest that either Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 was not applicable to the land, subject‑matter of dispute or the allotment of lands which were made before application of Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 to District Bahawalpur, would not be governed by the said Act after it was extended to the said District. The record would show that the tenancy of the suit‑land on promulgation of B Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 was to be governed by the said Act and Muhammad Din being tenant of the land, would be entitled to proprietary rights by operation of law and would become allottee under Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912. Consequently, the property would devolve upon his legal heirs under West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962. Learned counsel when confronted with the above legal position, he frankly conceded that from the present record it would not be ascertainable that under which Scheme, the land was allotted to Muhammad Din or that the scheme under which the allotment was made, was not subsequently, made part of Colonization of Government Lands Punjab) Act, 1912. Learned counsel for the petitioners has not raised any other point in support of this petition and we having perused the record with his help, have not been able to find out any defect or legal infirmity in the impugned judgment through which the High Court confirmed the concurrent judgments and decrees of the two Courts holding that Mst. Khurshid Bibi and Muhammad Ibrahim were entitled to inherit the property of Muhammad Din in equal share as his legal heirs. The finding of all the three Courts, that Mst. Khurshid Bibi being limited owner, would get 1/2 share in the property and remaining 1/2 would go to Muhammad Ibrahim, being not suffering from C any misreading or non‑reading of evidence; would not call for interference of this Court.
  7. For the foregoing reasons, this petition, has no substance and the same is accordingly dismissed. Leave is refused.

Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that Misri Khan was exclusive owner of the property as has been proved by his legal heirs on record through evidence, but the learned High Court as well as the Courts below have held otherwise by misreading the evidence on record, therefore, impugned judgment calls for interference by. this Court.
  4. We have heard learned counsel and have also gone through the impugned judgment carefully. Relevant para. is reproduced hereinbelow :---
  ""I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record. The learned two Courts, on the basis of the allotment chit, a certified copy of which was produced as Exh.P.1 found, that since the plaintiffs-respondents had been entered in the allotment chit, they were also entitled to the grant of proprietary rights. The contention that the allotment chit was tampered with was raised before learned First Appellate Court but was repelled. It may be noted that the petitioner did not assert in the written statement that inclusion of the names of the petitioners in the allotment chit was the result of tampering of the record or they were not entered in the allotment chit. The presumption of genuineness
attached to a certified copy of a public document is not misplaced by mere assertion. As far as the question of limitation is concerned, the plaintiffs-respondents were co-allottees with Misri their real brother, they became co-sharers with Misri and, therefore, question of limitation did not arise. In accordance with the Memorandum No.1740/2549-78 dated 21-11-1978, all members of the family included in the allotment chit were entitled to the grant of proprietary rights. This memorandum was noted in the case of Dil Bibi v. Noor Hussain and others 1990 CLC 1994. The matter stands concluded by concurrent findings of the learned two Courts. No case is made out for interference. This revision petition is dismissed.""
  5. Before the High Court two questions were under consideration i.e. whether the chit of allotment was a valid document and suit is within limitation or otherwise. Learned High Court after having taken into consideration the chit held that because its validity was not challenged in the written statement, therefore, it will be presumed that on the basis of same whole family is entitled for grant of proprietary rights in disputed property. As far as the second question with regard to limitation is concerned, in this behalf it is held that since the plaintiffs-respondents were co-allottees with Misri Khan their real brother, therefore, they become co-sharers with him, as such question of limitation did not arise.
  6. After hearing both the sides and having gone through the available record as well as the law on the subject we are of the opinion that impugned judgment being in accordance with law admits no interference by this Court.
  Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we see no substance in this petition as such same is dismissed and leave declined.

  ORDER
  MUNIR A. SHEIKH, J.---By this common judgment, we propose to decide all the titled petitions for leave to appeal involving identical questions of law and facts which have been directed against a consolidated judgment, dated 11-2-2002 of the Lahore High Court through which five writ petitions were decided.
  2. The petitioners in Civil Petition No.1151-L of 2002 were allotted evacuee land in dispute measuring 90 Kanals temporarily under the settlement laws. The matter for confirmation of the said allotment in their names was pending when on 3-1-1958, a notification was issued by the Federal Government for transfer of the said land to the Provincial Government to be utilized as State land.
  3. W.P. No.1743 of 1966 was filed by the said petitioners before the High Court that they being temporary allottees of the said land were entitled to confirmation of the said allotment under the settlement laws, as such, the notification allowing transfer of the said land to the Provincial Government dated 3-1-1958 was against law. It was accepted through judgment, dated 12-6-1970 and a direction was made that the said land shall be taken to have not ceased to be part of compensation pool, as such, remained available for confirmation of temporary allotment of the said petitioners.
  4. Thereafter, protracted litigation started, one on behalf of Siddique Textile Mills who claimed to be the lessee of the said land by the Provincial Government and the other on behalf of the petitioners in the said Civil Petition No.1151-L of 2002 for implementation of the said judgment for confirmation of their temporary allotment under judgment, dated 12-6-1970. Having failed to get land, Civil Appeal No.75 of 1983 was ultimately filed by Siddique Textile Mills before this Court which was accepted through judgment, dated 6-7-1983 and the case remanded to the Member, Board of Revenue to re-consider the case of the Textile Mills either for grant of lease/transfer of entire land measuring 11 acres, 5 Marlas or part of it, for previously, it was found to have beer) granted lease only in respect of land measuring 1 Acre, 5 Marlas about which also it was in breach. Civil Appeal No.25 of 1988 filed by the Provincial Government against judgment of acceptance of W.P. No.716-R of 1981 filed by temporary allottees seeking implementation of judgment, dated 12-6-1970 was dismissed.
  5. Siddique Textile Mills after having obtained judgment by this Court for remand of its case through judgment, dated 6-7-1983 filed application under section 12(2), C.P.C. in Civil Appeal No.25 of 1988 which was accepted through order, dated 4-12-1991 by observing that all the orders passed in these matters after 6-7-1983 when the appeal of Siddique Textile Mills Limited was accepted, were not effective as the said mill was not a party, therefore, the case of the petitioners/temporary allottees was also clubbed with the case of Siddique Textile Mills Limited which had earlier been remanded to the Board of Revenue for decision.
  6. After remand, the Board of Revenue held that Siddique Textile had no claim against the land, for it was in breach of the terms and conditions of the lease as it did not pay the lease money of land measuring 1 Acre, 5 Marlas which was allotted to it and as a whole it was not entitled to any portion of the land and further that Tufail deceased petitioner in Civil Petition No.1151-L of 2002 was entitled to confirmation of land measuring 68 Kanals, 5 Marlas. The remaining land was available but could not be transferred to any body else according to the decision of Martial Law Authorities, therefore, the matter for the disposal. of the said remaining land was closed against which W.Ps. Nos, 106-R of 1992 and 241-R of 1995 were filed both by different groups of Katchi Abadi, W.P. No.165-R of 1992 by Muhammad Anwar claiming part of the land as graveyard, W.P. No.129-R of 1992 by Siddique Textile Mills, W.P. No.23-R of 1995 by Rehmatullah a sub-lessee from Siddique Textile Mills, which have been disposed of through, common impugned judgment dated 11-2-2000 by the learned Judge in Chambers of the High Court against which all these petitions have been directed.
  7. The learned Judge of the High Court held that the Member, Board of Revenue could not go behind the judgment of this Court dated 6-7-1983 through which the case was remanded and without deciding about the merit or otherwise of the findings of the Board of Revenue, Siddique Textile Mills was held to be entitled to the transfer of the entire land measuring 11 Acre, 5 Marlas as a consequence of which the temporary allottee-Tufail deceased, etc. were deprived of the right of confirmation of the temporary allotment.
  8. It has been, inter alia, contended by Mr. S.M. Naseem, learned counsel for the petitioners in Civil Petition No.1151-L of 2002:--
  (a) that by virtue of judgment, dated 12-6-1970 passed in W.P. No.1743 of 1966, the transfer/exchange of evacuee land in dispute through notification dated 19-5-1958 did not alter the position that the land continued to be part of compensation pool, as such, Tufail deceased as temporary allottees were entitled to its confirmation as such, it was not a State land which could be disposed of by the Provincial Government in favour of Siddique Textile Mill or any body, etc.;
  (b) that Siddique Textile was never given lease of land measuring 11 Acre, 5 Marlas whereas mere proposal was made and possession was delivered to it without such lease, therefore, there was no question of transfer of the said land to it as lease;
  (c) that the Member, Board of Revenue had held that Siddique Textile was in breach of the terms of conditions of lease of the land measuring 1 acre, 5 Marlas as it did not pay the dues in time and further sub-let the area to Rehmatullah but the learned Judge of the High Court did not adjudicate upon the merits of these findings and mechanically proceeded to hold that by virtue of judgment of remand of this Court, the Board of Revenue had no choice but mechanically to transfer the land to Siddique Textile which was not correct interpretation of the said order, for the case of temporary allottees had also been clubbed with the said remand order;
  (d) that in view of the land being not available as State land, no part of it could be claimed to be part of graveyard or part of Katchi Abadi.
  9. The question, inter alia, as to what is the scope and legal position of judgment of remand of this Court, dated 12-6-1970 passed in W.P. No.1743 of 1966 and whether Siddique Textile was entitled to the transfer of the land after it had been held to be in breach of the conditions of lease require examination in depth, therefore, leave is granted io re-examine the case in its entirety.
  The interim order, dated 4-9-2002 shall continue till the disposal of the appeals.
  M.H./T-52/S Leave granted.

  JUDGMENT
  MUNIR A. SHEIKH, J.‑‑‑This petition is directed against the judgment dated 18‑10‑1999 of the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, Multan, through which Constitutional petition filed by the petitioners against the order dated 3‑5‑1984 of the Board of Revenue has been dismissed.
  2. The land in dispute was allotted to the private respondents as Islamabad affectees. This land was included in Islamabad Oustees Scheme for providing compensation to the persons who were affected by acquisition of their land for construction of capital area in Islamabad.
  3. The petitioners who are not allottees of any portion of the land in dispute under any scheme had filed writ petition before the High Court after a period of 12 years of the order dated 4‑8‑1986 passed by the Board of Revenue in revision petition filed by Iqbal and Qurban against the residents of Chak No.47/EB in which the petitioners were not party.
  4. It appears from the impugned judgment of the High Court that learned counsel for the petitioners appearing before the said Court was asked to point out any documentary evidence to show that the petitioners were in possession of any portion of the land who relied upon Annexure 'A‑1' appended with the petition. The learned Judge of the High Court found after appraisal of the said documents that Islamabad affectees were shown to be owners of the land in the said document and one Allah Yar was shown in possession of 12 Kanals out of that under an agreement of sale from the said owners. The said Allah Yar was found to have had recourse to the Civil Court by filing suit in which he failed. The appeal filed by him was dismissed by the First Appellate Court and revision petition filed before the High Court was also dismissed. He then filed Civil Petition No.1211‑L of 1995 before this Court which was dismissed on 7‑11‑1995 a copy of which judgment is available on the record of this petition.
  5. Learned counsel for the petitioners when questioned as to how; and in what manner, the petitioners claimed any nexus with the land in dispute muchless any right under any law submitted that they were in illegal possession of the land as trespassers and as they were entitled to A retain the same as Government was legally bound to provide them shelter as was done in the case of such occupants by sanctioning 5 Marlas Scheme by providing land elsewhere to accommodate such persons.
  6. We are afraid, if this ground could be a ground available in law to contest the claim of allottees under the Islamabad Oustees Scheme of the land in dispute. A trespasser could not claim any right to maintain the Constitutional petition. The petitioners should have independently approached the Government for providing them shelter and not to challenge the allotment of land made lawfully in favour of the respondents as Islamabad affectees under a scheme framed for them known as Islamabad Oustees Scheme in which this land was included.
  7. The judgment impugned in this petition of the High Court does not suffer from any legal infirmity, therefore, this petition has no merits which is accordingly dismissed and leave refused.
  S.A.K./A‑304/S Leave refused.

  ORDER
  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, J.----This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the judgment, dated 29th April, 1999 passed by Lahore High Court, Lahore whereby writ petition filed by the petitioners has been allowed.
  2. Precisely stating fact of the case are that the predecessor-in- interest of the petitioners on migration from India got allotted agricultural land in Chak No. 122 EB (former Tehsil Pakpattan; District Sahiwal presently falling in Tehsil Burewala, District Vehari) against their verified claim under the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Act""). In 1963 the predecessor-in- interest of the respondents Mana son. of Jamu lodged an information before the authorities under section 11 of the Act against the petitioners' predecessor-in--interest about getting allotted excess land. Accordingly in pursuance of such information the excess land was cancelled from the name of predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners as back as on 29th July, 1969. The petitioners preferred revision before the High Court, which was subsequently converted into a writ petition and was dismissed on 19th March; 1975. As such petitioners preferred civil petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.342 of 1975. Leave to appeal was declines confirming that the petitioners have in fact received excess allotment. While making such observations this Court observed as under:--
  ""The petitioners should go back and move the Settlement Authorities for allowing them to retain the excess area on payment of market value, on the ground that they have been in cultivating possession thereof since their original allotments and have developed the same. We feel certain that the Settlement Authorities will give due and sympathetic consideration to their cases.""
  It is important to note that after cancellation of the land from the name of the petitioners the concerned revenue authorities transferred the available land to the predecessor-in-interest of respondents namely Mana son of Jamu as back as on 29th August, 1969 and confirmed the same on 1st September, 1969 in exercise of jurisdiction under section 14A(1) of the Act.
  3. It so happened that after disposal of C.P.S.L.A. No.342 of 1975 by this, Court the petitioners submitted an application on 17th March, 1976 for allotment of excess land, which was previously cancelled from their name. The Assistant Commissioner vide order, dated 19th February, 1976 sold an area equal to 30 PIUs at the rate of Rs.10 per PIU in -favour of petitioner Chiragh Din son of Noor Muhammad whereas vide order, dated 17th March, 1976 an area equal to 49 PlUs was sold to petitioners at the rate of Rs.10 per PIU. The order referred to hereinabove was questioned by respondent Mana son of Jamu by filing Writ Petition No.1258-R/1977 before the Lahore High Court, Lahore which has been allowed by means of impugned judgment; dated 29-4 1999. As such instant petition for leave to appeal has been filed.
  4. Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that order passed by this Court in C.P.S.L.A. No.342 of 1975 was a remand order in terms of section 2(2) of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws Repeals Act, 1975, therefore, the Assistant Commissioner being a notified authority with lawful authority sold 79 PIUs to the petitioners respectively vide order, dated 19-2-1976' and 17th March, 1976, therefore, the High Court in exercise of its Constitutional powers had no jurisdiction to set aside these orders. In support of his contention he relied upon Farhat Azeem v. Waheed Rasul and others (PLD 2000 SC 18).
  5. On the other hand learned counsel appearing for the caveators contended that this Court had not remanded the case to the Settlement Authorities by issuing a direction obviously for the reason that on merits no relief was, given to petitioners because the argument put forward on behalf of the petitioners before the High Court with regard cancellation of excess land from the name of the petitioners under section 11 of the Act was not accepted except making an observation that let the petitioners approach the Settlement Department for reconsideration of their case sympathetically because they were not holding excess land in their name on the basis of fraud etc. and they are also in cultivating possession. According to him reconsidering the case of the petitioners on sympathetically basis would not mean remand of the case but called upon the authorities to consider the case of the petitioners favourably and in accordance with law. He further stated that as the respondents got allotment of the land which was surrendered by the petitioners as far back as on 1st September, 1969 in terms of section 14A(1) of the Act, therefore, even if the authorities had considered the case of the petitioners sympathetically it had no jurisdiction to sell the same to the petitioners because it was not available having been sold earlier to the respondent.
  6. We have heard parties counsel and have also gone through the impugned judgment carefully as well as earlier judgment passed by the Court as back as on 9th July, 1975, relevant portion there from has been reproduced hereinabove. There is absolutely no doubt that in pursuance of the judgment of this Court referred to hereinabove the cancellation of the land from the name of the petitioners was confirmed because the judgment of the High Court, dated 10th March, 1975 passed in Writ Petition No.806-R/1972 was operating against them and it was not set aside despite of the fact that specifically it was argued on behalf of the petitioners that under section 11 of the Act the decision of the High Court is in conflict. To strengthen the argument reference was made to PLD 1964 Lahore 469 and PLD 1972 Lahore 880. 'But this Court repelled the argument by making an observation to the effect that as regards second point is concerned, we do not think that the same needs to be decided. Therefore, no other conclusion can be drawn except that despite making favourable observations in favour of petitioners directing them to approach the Settlement Authorities, the latter was not asked sell the property to the petitioners except observing that their should be considered sympathetically. Therefore, we are of the that the case was not remanded to the Settlement Authorities redressal of grievance of the petitioners necessarily. This examined in view of the observations made by this Court in the case of Farhat Azeem (ibid) that under Article 189 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan the Supreme Court is the highest judicial forum in the country, it has to interpret the law while hearing appeals from the judgments of the High Court and the subordinate judiciary. Invariably such matters are considered by more than one Judges having long experience and thrash out the proposition brought before them in the light of the chain of judgments rendered on the controversy in issue and ensure that continuity of law is maintained as it is essential for good judicial administration. The subordinate judiciary should always give its utmost respect, regard and consideration to the judgments, decrees, directions and orders of the Supreme Court, for, it is necessary apart from the binding nature of the same for maintaining discipline in all ranks of judiciary, no other conclusion can be drawn that undoubtedly under Article 189 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan the judgments are required to be respected particularly if it has decided a question of law or enunciated a principle of law. We feel no hesitation in making observation that in the earlier judgment pronounced by this Court in C.P.S.L.A. No.342 of 1975 we have not remanded the case to the Settlement Authorities for doing the needful in favour of petitioners after setting aside the orders operating against them because our observations were that the claim of the petitioners can be considered sympathetically. Obviously the claim can of the petitioners only be considered if they succeed in establishing a legal right in their favour. Admittedly after the cancellation of land from the name of petitioners it was transferred permanently in favour of respondents, as back as in the year 1969 in terms of section 14A(1) of the Act, therefore, the land was not available for disposal in favour of the petitioners. Simultaneously the notified authority had no right to cancel the allotment from the name of respondents by recalling order, dated 1st September, 1969 which was passed under section 14A(1) of the Act because after allotment of land in favour of respondents a right has accrued in their favour' in terms of of this Court in the case of Jehangir Khan and 9 others v. Mst. Begum (1996 SCMR 1504).
  7. It may also be noted that the contention of the learned counsel that the observations favourably made to favour of petitioners tantamounts to remand the case to the notified authority is not acceptable because considering the case of sympathetically means that he should be accommodated if possible but not at the cost of others, therefore, in our opinion the Assistant. Commissioner erred in law in passing order it favour of petition on 17th March, 1976 for number of reasons out of which one could be that when there is no property available for transfer how the petitions could be accommodated by considering their request sympathetically. Secondly the allotment of the cancelled land from the name of petition has already been confirmed in favour of respondents with effect from 1st September, 1969 and until and unless that order holds the field no subsequent sale of the property to the petitioners can take place. Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that this Court has not remanded the case to the notified authority/Assistant Commissioner a setting aside the order, dated 10th Match, 1975 in Writ Petition No.806 of 1972 operating against the petitioners and because order of cancellation of excess land has been confirmed by this Court, therefore, Assistant Commissioner had no authority to pass fresh order in their favour causing serious prejudice/injustice to the respondents who have acquired valuable rights in the property as held by this Court in the case of Jehangir and others (ibid). Thus under these circumstances learned High Court was quite justified in allowing the writ petition filed by respondents vide impugned judgment.
  As such for the foregoing reasons we see no merit in instant petition, therefore, the same is dismissed and leave to appeal declined.
  S.A.K./S-228/S Leave refused.

  JUDGMENT
  TANVIR AHMED KHAN, J. ---Leave to appeal is sought against the order, dated 7-2-2000 whereby a learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court, Lahore, dismissed the Constitutional Petition filed by the petitioners.
  2. Facts briefly stated are that the consolidation operation of village Nawan Saggu, Tehsil Khushab, District Sargodha, was completed on 26-4-1972 Being aggrieved, the petitioner's brother (Sultan) filed an appeal which was accepted by the Additional Deputy Commissioner/ Collector, Sargodha through his order, dated 14-6-1973 and the case was remanded to the Assistant Consolidation Office, Jauharabad. However, appeal was filed by Ahmed Bukhsh (Respondent No.3) against the said order which was rejected by the Additional Commissioner Consolidation on 24-9-1973 who upheld the remand order. Thereafter, the Assistant Consolidation Officer, took up the matter and gave hearing to all the parties concerned. He made adjustment by making separate block through his order, dated 14-5-1976. Ahmed Bakhsh (respondent No.3) filed an appeal assailing the above order, which was accepted by the Additional Commissioner vide his order, dated 2-7-1978. Revision Petition filed by the petitioners against the same was also dismissed by the learned Member (Consolidation), Board of Revenue, Punjab on 15-3-1980. Constitutional Petition filed against the same has also-met the same fate as it was dismissed by a learned Single Judge, through the impugned order, dated 7-2-2000. Hence, this petition for leave to appeal.
  3. It is inter alia, argued that the previous possession of the parties has not been taken into consideration while effecting consolidation.
  4. We have considered the above contention raised b-v the learned counsel for the petitioners and have gone through the documents appended with this petition. It is reflected from the perusal thereof that the Revenue forums after taking into account the respective pleas of the parties, dismissed claim of the petitioners. It would be appropriate to reproduce the determination of the Member, Board of Revenue. which has been maintained by the learned Single Judge. The determination is as under:---
  ""4. The record shows that the petitioner's land has been consolidated at two places. The bigger plot is at the place where he held major portion of his land before consolidation. The petitioner is benefited. There is also no shortage in his entitlement. Instead there is an excess of .12 Marlas in terms of, Class 1. The Khata of the petitioner was joint before consolidation. The request of the petitioner to allot Khasra Nos. 7 and 10 of Square No. 1967 cannot be acceded to as he has already got Khasra Nos. 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10 (total 35 Kanals in Rectangle No. 1967). Therefore, he cannot claim more area at this place as he was in possession of 10 Kanals at this place before consolidation. I see no force in the revision petition which is accordingly dismissed.""
  5. The question of fact after scanning the record has been determined by the Revenue Authorities and no illegality has been committed by the learned Judge in maintaining the same reference is made to the cases of ""Muhammad Badar-ul-Munir v. Chairman, Arbitration Council and 2 others"" 1989 SCMR 1097 and ""Allah Rehman and others v: Amtul Qayyum and another"" 1989 SCMR 1817.
  6. Resultantly, for what has been stated above, the instant petition being without merit is dismissed and leave refused.

  ORDER
  TANVIR AHMAD KHAN, J.‑‑‑Leave to appeal is sought against the judgment, dated 23‑10‑2002 whereby a learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, Multan, accepted Civil Revision No.621/D of 1987 filed by the respondents and restored the determination of the learned trial Court rendered on 3‑3‑1987 whereby the suit for possession filed by them was decreed.
  2. The facts briefly narrated for the disposal of this petition are that the disputed property was secured by the predecessor‑in‑interest of the respondents Siraj Din in an open auction from the Settlement Department as far back as in the year 1973 and a P.T.D. for the same was issued. Said Siraj Din filed a suit for possession claiming tire disputed property on the basis of the aforesaid P.T.D. issued by the Settlement Department in his name on successful completion of auction proceedings held in the year 1973. The petitioners denied the claim of the respondent and took up a preliminary objection that the P.T.P. had been obtained through fraud and misrepresentation. It was also averred that the disputed property was not available for allotment as the same was attached to the school. Out of contradictory pleadings of the parties, issues were framed. The parties led their evidence and the learned Civil Judge 1st Class, Multan, through his judgment, dated 21‑2‑1983 decreed the suit. On an appeal filed by the petitioners, the learned Additional District Judge, Multan, set aside the judgment of the trial Court and remanded the case to the latter Court by framing an additional issue qua the report of the Local Commissioner. The parties again led their evidence and the learned trial Court vide its judgment, dated 3‑3‑1987 decreed the suit. The petitioners filed an appeal assailing the above judgment, which was allowed by the learned Additional District Judge, Multan, through his judgment, dated 19‑7‑1987. The respondents filed aforesaid civil revision before the Lahore High Court at Multan Bench, Multan, which has been accepted by a learned Single Judge vide his judgment, dated 23‑10‑2002, impugned herein. Hence, this petition for leave to appeal.
  3. We have considered the contentions advanced by the learned Law Officer appearing on behalf of the petitioners and have gone through the entire material placed on record with his assistance. It is reflected from the perusal thereof that the allotment of the disputed property through P.T.D. has been admitted by all the Courts below. The issue bearing No.5 framed to the effect, whether the P.T.D. was obtained by the respondent through fraud and misrepresentation, has been answered in the negative. It is pertinent to mention here that till date even the issuance of P.T.D. has not been questioned before any forum and no step whatsoever has been taken by the petitioners to get the same cancelled. The Settlement Department as well as the Revenue forums time and again endorsed the factual controversy that the disputed property claimed by the petitioners was secured by the predecessor‑in -interest of the respondents Siraj Din as far back as in the year 1973. The plea of the petitioners that the property under dispute vests in the petitioners in view of Martial Law Order No.264 is devoid of any force as no issue qua this assertion was framed and the petitioners have not brought any evidence on record to substantiate the same. The learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court has given cogent reasons in restoring the judgment of the trial Court. A factual controversy regarding allotment of the disputed property has been determined by the trial Court which has been maintained by a learned Single Judge of the High Court. As already stated after the allotment of the disputed property in the name of the predecessor‑in‑interest of the respondents, the Settlement Department demarcated the same in presence of the Incharge of the hostel of the school. The plea of the petitioners that the allotted property was different as compared to the claim made by the respondent has been repelled by the learned Single Judge in the following words:‑‑‑
  ""Whereas no evidence: was brought by the respondents to show that the suit property was not property No.23 but the same was property No.21 which was transferred to them. In the absence of such evidence, the claim of the petitioners as set out in the plaint was liable to be given an upper edge particularly when they successfully established that the property in possession of the respondents was in fact the property which was owned by their predecessor deceased Siraj Din. It is also noticed that the report Exh.P.4 was prepared by Muhammad Rafique Qureshi an Inspector of the Settlement Department on 18‑11‑1973 whereupon the Deputy Settlement Commissioner passed the following order on 27‑12‑1973:‑‑
  ""Demarcation be arranged through the Revenue Patwari in the presence of the transferee as well as the Incharge of the hostel.""
  Pursuant to it, demarcation was conducted in the presence of the parties. At that time no objection was taken regarding such proceedings. It cannot be ignored that even before the Secretary Baldiya, Jalalpur Pirwala before whom the proceedings were being held regarding sanctioning of a house on the demised premises, respondents failed to bring any evidence in support of their claim. Reference may be made to Exh. P.6.""
  Learned Law Officer has failed to point out any illegality or legal infirmity in the impugned judgment warranting interference by this Court.
  4. The upshot of the above discussion is that the instant petition being devoid of any merit is hereby dismissed and leave refused.
  S.A.K./P‑10/S Leave refused.

  ORDER
  KHALIL-UR-REHMAN RAMDAY, J.---One Rehmat Ali (the predecessor in interest of the respondents mentioned at Serial No.2) migrated to Pakistan in the year 1947 from Mauza Dherian, Tehsil and District Hoshiarpur and settled in Chak No.541/G.B. while one Wali Muhammad (predecessor-in-interest of the respondents mentioned at Serial No.3 in this petition) also migrated to Pakistan but from village Lavian of Tehsil and District Hoshiarpur and he also settled to the same Chak No.541/G.B of Tehsil Samundari of now District Faisalabad. Both of them had independent families and were allotted 135 Kanals and 11 Marlas of land in the said Chak No.541/G.B. under the Refugee Re Settlement Scheme of 1949. The said scheme was then converted into Ejected Tenants Scheme. The said Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad applied for the grant of proprietary rights in the above mentioned land. The Commissioner of Sargodha Division within which division Tehsil Samundari then fell, accorded sanction to the grant of proprietary rights in the said land to the said Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad by means of sale by private treaty. This was done through an order, dated 17-11-1996 of the said Commissioner.
  2. It appears from the record that the predecessors-in-interest of the present petitioners namely Aziz Din and Ali Muhammad approached some authorities for grant of proprietary rights to them in the land in question independently of Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad. No application moved for the purpose is on record and we therefore, do not know the basis on which this claim had been made. However, 'the matter appears to have reached the Commissioner of Sargodha Division who through an order, dated 5-6-1975 declared that the proprietary rights could be granted only to the heads of the families and that in case somebody felt aggrieved of the same then such a person could approach the Civil Court for establishing his rights. Neither the said Aziz Din nor the said Ali Muhammad approached the Civil Court for the purpose. Thereafter the Deputy Commissioner/Collector of then District of Layllpur (now Faisalabad), through an order, dated 30-5-1978 proceeded to implement the above mentioned order, dated 17-11-1966 of the Commissioner of Sargodha Division. This order of the- Deputy Commissioner was challenged in appeal before the Additional Commissioner (Revenue) of Sargodha Division which dismissed the same through an order, dated 22-4-1979. The matter was then taken to the Board of Revenue and the revision petition was also dismissed through an order, dated 10-5-1979 observing that the grant of proprietary rights to Wali Muhammad and Rehmat Ali was in accordance with the policy instructions and that Aziz Din and Ali Muhammad, Predecessors-in interest of the present petitioners had no right to claim proprietary rights as independent allottees. No further challenge was thrown to this order of the Board of Revenue which thus attained finality whereafter the requisite conveyance deed was executed in favour of the said Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad which was registered on 21-7-1980. Mutation No. 895 was consequently sanctioned through an order, dated 31-7-1980. From a further order of Board of Revenue, dated 8-2-1983, it appears that the above mentioned Aziz Din and Ali Muhammad moved some further application before the Board of Revenue under section 30(2) of the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act of 1912, seeking cancellation of the above mentioned order, dated 17-11-1966 of the Commissioner, Sargodha Division granting proprietary rights of the land in question to Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad. Pursuant to the said application the Board of Revenue took up the matter, in exercise of its suo motu revisional jurisdiction and held that Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad above mentioned were to be treated as a single entity for the purpose of grant of proprietary rights under the Ejected Tenants Scheme and both of them were jointly entitled only to 64 Kanals of land; that the Commissioner was in error in granting proprietary rights to them through his order, dated 17-11-1966 to the extent of 134 Kanals and 8 Marlas of land; that the conveyance deed above mentioned in favour of Rehmat Ali and Wali, Muhammad for the said piece of land and the consequent mutation sanctioned in their families for the same was erroneous. He consequently set aside the order of the Commissioner, dated 17-11-1966; cancelled the above mentioned conveyance deed in favour of 'Wali Muhammad and Rehmat Ali with respect to 134 Kanals and 8 Marlas of land and revoked the consequent Mutation No-.895 sanctioned in their favour. He directed the Commissioner concerned to inquire into the matter afresh keeping in view the policy on the point and considering Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad to be entitled to one tenancy.
  3. The said Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad questioned the said order of the Board of Revenue, dated 8-2-1983 before the Lahore High Court through Writ Petition No.3340 of 1983 which petition was allowed by the Hon'ble High Court through a judgment, dated 3-4-2002. Hence this petition.
  4. We have examined the record in the light of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioners.
  5. From the above mentioned order, dated 8-2-1983 of the Board of Revenue, it appears that the .predecessors-in-interest of .the present petitioners had sought cancellation of the grant of land to Wali Muhammad and Rehmat Ali on the ground that the land in question fell within the prohibitory zone; that Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad had never cultivated the land in question personally and it was the above mentioned Ali Muhammad and Aziz Din who used to cultivate the same as tenants paying Battai to Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad and that in the circumstances they were the ones who were entitled to the grant of proprietary rights of the land in question being in actual cultivating possession of the same.
  6. The learned High Court, however, found that Wali Muhammad and Rehmat Ali belonged to two different villages of District Hoshiarpur in India that they stood separately listed as heads of two independent families; that they had been assigned separate serial numbers in the Register of Temporary Allotments; that the mattes of their entitlement had been scrutinized and assessed at different levels starting from the Collector of the District up to the Board of Revenue and it had never ever been found that they were not refugees from India or that they were not independent families or that they were not entitled to allotment of the land in question and that in the circumstances it could not be said that Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad had committed any fraud in securing allotment of the land in question or had made any misrepresentation for the said purpose: It may be added that in the above mentioned order, dated 8-2-1983 the Board of Revenue had not given any reason whatsoever for concluding that Rehmat Ali and Wali Muhammad were not heads of independent families and were not entitled to separate and independent tenancies in the land in question.
  7. Having thus examined all aspects of the matter, we find that no exception could be taken to the impugned judgment of the Hon'ble Lahore High Court. This petition is therefore, dismissed. Leave refused. A

  JUDGMENT
  FAQIR MUHAMMAD KHOKHAR, J.---The petitioner seeks the grant of leave to appeal from the judgment, dated 12-5-1999 and 25-4-1997 respectively passed by the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, Multan in I.C.A. No. 99 of 1997 and Writ Petition No. 5327 of 1980.
  2. The petitioner claimed to be a lessee of the State land under five years temporary cultivation scheme under the allotment order, dated 24-10-1975 by the Colony Assistant/Collector which was set aside by order, dated 9-7-1997 by the Additional Commissioner on an appeal filed by Ghulam Nabi. The revision petition of the petitioner- was also dismissed by order, dated 12-1-1978 passed by the Member, Board of Revenue as the lease in favour of the petitioner was found void ab initio. Thereafter, the petitioner resorted to civil litigation and obtained a temporary injunction on 1-3-1979 from the Civil Court which was vacated by the Appellate Court on 28-2-1980. The petitioner claimed that by virtue of Notification, dated 3-9-1979 issued by the Board of Revenue, he was entitled to acquire the proprietary rights of the land in dispute. During the proceedings on the Revenue side it transpired that a major chunk of the land in question had already been allotted to Ghulam Nabi by order, dated 22-9-197.5. Therefore, the lot leased out to petitioner was included in the schedule prepared by the Board of Revenue, by Notification, dated 7-2-1980, for auction of the property. The petitioner filed a Writ Petition No.5327 of 1980 challenging the Notification, dated 7-2-1980 for the auction of the land in dispute which was dismissed by order, dated 25-4-1997 by the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench. The petitioner filed Intra-Court Appeal thereafter which was also dismissed by the impugned judgment, dated 12-5-1989 by a learned Division Bench of the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench. Hence this petition for leave to appeal.
  3. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the petitioner was entitled to the conferment of proprietary rights of the land in dispute which had been validly allotted in his favour under the temporary cultivation scheme for a period of five years.
  4. During the pendency of this petition Ghulam Nabi, who was allotted land measuring 48 Kahals out of the land in dispute, made an application for being impleaded as a necessary party. The same is, allowed and Ghulam Nabi' is added as respondent No.3.
  5. The learned counsel for respondent No.3 argued that the said respondent was duly allotted 48 Kanals out of the land in dispute on 25-9-1975 which was upheld by order, dated 9-7-1977 by the Additional Commissioner as well as by the Board of Revenue by order, dated 12-1-1978 whereas the allotment in favour of the petitioner was declared to be void ab initio. The orders passed by the Revenue Authorities became final in all respects qua the parties.
  6. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as for the respondent No.3 at length. We find that the orders, dated 9-7-1977 and 12-1-1978 passed by the Additional Commissioner as well as by the Board of Revenue setting aside the allotment of land of the petitioner and confirming the allotment of the respondent No.3 became final qua the parties. Thereafter, the Revenue Authorities were justified to include the portion of the land in dispute, excluding the one already allotted to Ghulam Nabi, in the schedule for auction by virtue of order, dated 7-2-1980. In these circumstances, the petitioner who was no longer a lessee of the land could not claim the grant of proprietary, rights. The view taken by the Lahore High Court in the writ petition as well as in the Intra-Court Appeal by the impugned judgments is unexceptionable. No substantial question of law of general public importance is involved in this case.
  7. This petition has no merit and the same is dismissed accordingly. No order as to costs.

  JUDGMENT
  FAQIR MUHAMMAD KHOKHAR, J.---The respondent No.6 was declarant under the Land Reforms Regulation (MLR 115) of 1972, who had gifted certain portion of his land through Mutation No.298, dated 9-8-1969 to his brother Zaigham Hayat, respondent No.7 and another portion to his mother Dure-e-Nazim Shahwar deceased and to a stranger Haji Mehraj Din respondent No.8 by Mutation No.312 sanctioned on 13-5-1970. Out of these transactions the gift in favour of respondents No.7 and 8 v,4V held to be invalid whereas the gift of the land in favour of Mst. Dure-e-Nazim Shahwar, the mother of respondent No.6, as valid, by .the Land Commission Authorities.
  2. In the meantime the respondents Nos. 3 to 5 purchased the land from the said donees through Mutations Nos.348 and 364, dated 11-3-1971 and 28-2-1972 respectively. The respondent No.6 filed a declaration before the Land Reforms Authorities under MLR 115 declaring himself to be the owner of the entire land measuring 10 squares equal to 28878 P. I. Units. He was, therefore, required to surrender the excess land to the Land Reforms Authorities for resumption and disposal in terms of paragraph 18 of the said Regulation. Therefore the respondent No.6 exercised the choice of the surrender of the excess land in dispute which had been transferred to the respondents Nos.3 to 5. The Land Reforms Authorities passed orders for resumption and further allotment of the excess land under paragraph 18 ibid to the petitioners as landless tenants. Therefore, the respondents Nos.3 to 5 filed Writ Petition No. 1763 of 1978 on the ground, inter alia, that in view of the other available excess land for resumption, the one which had already been alienated to them by way- of sale could not be surrendered. The writ petition of respondents Nos.3 to 5 was accepted by the Lahore High Court whereby it was directed that respondent No.6 would be called upon to surrender the land other than the one already alienated to respondents Nos.3 to 5, and if any land was still available, the same would be transferred to the present petitioners who were claiming to be landless tenants. ??????????? `
  3. The learned counsel for the petitioners argue that the order, dated 3-4-1976 passed by the Federal Land Commission under MLR 115 declaring the invalidity of the gifts, by the respondent No.6 in favour of his brother and a stranger, had attained finality which could not be set aside by the Lahore High Court in the exercise of its Constitutional jurisdiction. The transactions of alienation by way of~sale in favour of respondents Nos.3 to 5 could not be treated as valid. The resumed land having been allotted, by the Land Reforms Authorities, in favour of the petitioners being landless tenants, could not have been withdrawn from them. The declarant had validly exercised his choice for the surrender and resumption of land which had been sold to the respondents Nos.3 to 5. In these circumstances, it was argued, the declarant who had a freedom of choice to surrender any excess land of his holding could not be compelled to surrender a particular land already allotted to the petitioners for resumption.
  4. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents Nos.3 to 5 argued that the gift of the part of property by the respondent No.6 in favour of his mother had been held-to be valid. Therefore the declarant did not have any absolute right in the matter of surrender of the excess land . thereby adversely affecting the rights of the respondents Nos.3 to 5 in whose favour the land alread stood alienated b sale by the mother of declarant.
  5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length. The learned counsel for the petitioners has not been able to persuade us as to ho\v the determination by the Land Reforms Authorities under a sub-?Constitutional legislation was immune from the scrutiny of the High Court in the exercise of Constitutional jurisdiction. The rights of the respondents Nos.3 to 5 as a result of prior alienation of the property in dispute had already been created which could not be disturbed at the sweet will of the declarant by the exercise of choice to surrender the alienated land. The respondents Nos.3 to 5 being vendees were within their right to invoke the Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court for a direction for the surrender of the land othor than the alienated one to preserve their vested rights in the land in dispute. Reference may usefully be made to the case of Mst. Zohran Khatoon v. Member, Federal Land Commission, Rawalpindi (1985 SCMR 312). Needless to say that the petitioners landless tenants could be considered for the grant of the land in accordance with law, and subject to their eligibility, out of the other available excess land surrendered for resumption and disposal. Therefore, the petitioners could not claim any priority of allotment qua the vested rights of respondents Nos.3 to 5. This was necessary for preserving and safeguarding the rights created as a result of transaction of alienation of sale of land which had been found to be valid as between the private parties. In this case a transaction of gift of a part of disputed land made by the respondent? No.6 to his mother Mst. Dure-e-Nazim Shahwar deceased was held by the Land Reforms Authorities to be valid which she further sold to the respondents No.3 to 5.???????????
  6. The impugned judgment doing the substantial justice between the parties does not call for any interference by this Court. This is not a fit case for grant of leave to appeal.
  7. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any merit in this petition and the same is dismissed accordingly. No order as to costs.

  ORDER
  RANA BHAGWANDAS, J.--Petitioners seek leave to appeal against Lahore High Court Judgment, dated 14-3-2002 in Writ )petition No.621 of 1971 allowing writ petition filed by Province of Punjab and others, impugning correctness of the order, dated 30-12-1971 passed by Commissioner, Sargodha Division on a Reference from Governor Punjab as well. as from the Administrator, Thai Development Authority i.e. Chief Secretary Punjab.
  2. Notice was issued to the respondents as well as the Advocate General, Punjab vide order, dated 6-5-2002 but none has entered appearance.
  3. Petitioners' land measuring 213 acres situated iri Chak No.64-MB, Mouza Ahirpur, District Sargodha (now District 'Khusab) was acquired by Thal Development Authority for establishment Of Mandi Town, Joharabad way back. in the year 1951. In terms of the policy decision as contained in letter No.53-C, dated 5th January, 195:2 by the Board of Revenue Punjab, Annex. R/ 1, alternate land had to be granted to the petitioner in Colony Chaks in the close proximity of the Mandi Town as far as possible but the land given to the petitioner in Chak No.40-A/MB (Rakh Mitha Tiwana) was situated 14 miles away 'from the Mandi Town. It was the grievance of the petitioners that the ,alternate land was available for allotment in Chak No-52-MB at a distance of about three miles. Accordingly, they made a representation to the Governor Punjab in a public gathering at joharabad, which wad marked to the Commissioner, Sargodha to look into the matter. A report was also called for from the Thal Development Authority, who also referred -the case to the Commissioner, Sargodha Division for necessary action. On his part, Commissioner, Sargodha vide order, dated 30-12-1970 accepted, the plea taken by the petitioners and directed the, allotment of land in Chak Nos.52-MB and 53-MB. It appears that defunct Agricultural Development Corporation had some claim over this land, who, through the Government of Punjab impugned the order Massed by the Commissioner in the writ petition, which has been accepted by the High Court on the premises that the sanction of the Provincial Government had not been obtained for the grant of land to the petitioners in lieu of land acquired for public purpose.
  4. It is contended that valuable proprietary rights of the petitioners secured and guaranteed under Article 24 of the Constitution could not be abridged and curtailed or terminated to their disadvantage without just and lawful compensation. The grounds, which weighed with the learned Judge in the High Court, on the face of it ,appear to be unreasonable and hypertechnical in nature, inasmuch as, the Commissioner formed a part of the Government of Punjab, whose responsibility, inter alia, was to compensate the petitioners to provide lands in lieu of the lands compulsorily acquired. In our considered opinion, even if sanction or Provincial Government was necessary, it could be obtained ex post facto for which petitioner's rights cannot be jeopardized. Essentially, the lane was granted to ADC for development but it appears that it was not used for the purpose for which it was granted. Furthermore, ADC was dissolved through Presidential Order No.5 of 1972 with effect from 7-2-1972 and its rights and liabilities devolved on the Provincial Government.
  5. Contentions raised appear to be of first impression and not without substance. Leave to appeal is accordingly granted to consider the questions raised at the Bar.
  6. Learned counsel states at the Bar that the petitioners are in physical occupation of the land for the last over thirty years. Their possession shall not be disturbed till the decision of this appeal.

  ORDER
  TANVIR AHMED KHAN, J.---Leave to appeal is sought against the judgment, dated 10-8-2000 of a learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court, Lahore, whereby petitioner's Writ Petition No. 140/R of 2000 was dismissed.
  The facts briefly narrated are that the petitioner filed aforesaid writ petition laying claim to land measuring 2 Kanals, 2 Marlas comprising Khasra No.191, Khata No :101 in village Kotli Loharan, Tehsil Cantt. Lahore, whereon he had constructed some rooms. The petitioner through the above writ petition challenged the order, dated 19-8-1999 of the Board of Revenue/Chief Settlement Commissioner whereby the above property had , been reserved for construction of a primary school.
  Learned counsel has stated that the petitioner earlier made an application on 5-11-1977 for allotment of the disputed property and submitted R.P. Form which had been rejected through order, dated 19-8-1999 on the ground that the land in dispute had already been reserved for construction of a primary school.
  We have considered the contentions of the learned counsel and .have gone through the documents placed on record. We have noticed that the petitioner is admittedly a trespasser and has got no legal basis to claim the disputed property which has already been reserved for a noble and public purpose. Circular letter, dated 12-10-1993 of the Board of Revenue relied upon by the petitioner is certainly not attracted to his case as the same is applicable to the disposal of State land/Nazul land. Apart from this, the learned Judge has rightly refused to exercise Constitutional jurisdiction as the same cannot be invoked to perpetuate the gain/property secured through illegal means.
  In view of what has been stated above, the instant petition being without any merit is accordingly dismissed and leave declined.

  ORDER
  TANVIR AHMED KHAN, J.‑‑‑Leave to appeal is sought against the judgment dated 4‑4‑2002 whereby Writ Petition bearing No.3100 of 1993 filed by the petitioner was dismissed upholding the determination of Revenue Authorities.
  2. Facts briefly are that the respondent Noor Muhammad was allotted disputed land on 12‑10‑1954 under Grow More Food Scheme. This allotment was cancelled in the year 1962 in view of the Circular No.2805‑62/23 -S(G)III dated 8‑8‑1962. Subsequently the Government issued a general Order through Notification on 26‑4‑1971 directing that the Grow More Food Scheme allottees should be restored the land from which they had been ousted if the land in question had not been allotted under any permanent scheme. Instead of acting under aforestated notification the petitioner was given on lease the disputed land in the year 1972 under a temporary scheme for five years. Noor Muhammad challenged this allotment/lease and the learned Additional Commissioner (Revenue), Sargodha vide his order dated 2‑4‑1973 partially accepted the appeal. The petitioner as well as the respondent Noor Muhammad both filed revision petitions which were disposed of by the ,learned Member Colonies, Board of Revenue, Punjab through consolidated judgment dated 8‑5‑1975. It was noted by the learned Member in the judgment that at the time of issuance of aforementioned Notification dated 26‑4‑1971 Noor Muhammad respondent was in possession. The Collector in oblivion of the said Notification auctioned the disputed land for a period of five years in the year 1972, to the petitioner as such the lessee i.e. the petitioner should not suffer for the fault of Revenue Officer. He, however, maintained and the same was also agreed by Noor Muhammad respondent that he would wait for another two years till lease of Noor Zaman petitioner expires.
  3. In spite of this determination the Collector Toba Tek Singh firstly extended the lease for a period of one year then through another order dated 24‑9‑1978 extended the lease up to Rabi 1983. The respondent Noor Muhammad approached the Collector/Deputy Commissioner, Toba Tek Singh for the restoration of the land earlier allotted to him under Grow More Food Scheme in view of Notification dated 26‑4‑1971. The Collector through an order dated 4‑2‑1990 accepted the prayer for restoration of respondent Noor Muhammad holding. that the disputed land should not have been given on lease to the petitioner Noor Zaman in the year 1972 in the presence of Notification dated 26‑4‑1971 whereby direction for restoration of the Grow More Food to allottees was already issued. The petitioner challenged this order through an appeal before the Commissioner, Faisalabad Division, Faisalabad who vide. his judgment dated 3‑6‑1990 rejected the appeal. The petitioner thereafter challenged the order of Commissioner before the Member, Judicial Board of Revenue, Punjab who vide his order dated 14‑9‑1992 dismissed the revision petition.
  4. The petitioner thereafter filed Writ Petition No.3100 of 1993 challenging the orders of the Revenue Authorities and prayed conferment of proprietary rights upon him in view of notification issued by the Government of Punjab on 3‑9‑1979. The said writ petition has been dismissed through a detailed order vide the impugned judgment dated 4‑4‑2002. Hence this petition for leave to appeal.
  5. We have considered the contentions and have gone through the entire documents appended with this petition. We have noticed that in this case for no fault of respondent Noor Muhammad he has been successfully kept out of possession by the petitioner for all this period. The land was allotted to the respondent under Grow More Food Scheme in the year 1956. It was cancelled in the year 1962 upon a general order issued by the Government. However, subsequently on 26‑4‑1971 the Government issued another notification protecting the rights of the Grow More Food Scheme allottees. The petitioner was never in the picture when the aforesaid notification was promulgated. However, the Collector without taking into notice the aforesaid Notification granted the disputed property through auction for a lease period of five years to the petitioner. The learned Member, Board of Revenue in a beneficial manner, so as to protect the right of the petitioner, allowed him vide his order dated 8‑5‑1975 to complete his lease period. He categorically stated that Collector should not have given the lease of the disputed land to the petitioner ‑in presence of Notification dated 26‑4‑1991. However, he held that the petitioner Noor Zaman should not suffer for the fault of Revenue Officer as such he allowed him to complete his lease period of five years ending in 1977. The matter does not end over here. The petitioner again succeeded to get extension of his lease through an order issued in a slipshod manner by the Collector on 24‑9‑1978 which is in the following terms:‑‑
This Revenue Officer while extending the lease had not at all bothered to go through the earlier orders passed by the Revenue Authorities. The respondent was ultimately given his right by the Collector through order dated 4‑2‑1990 but the same remained under challenge before different forums at the behest of the petitioner and ultimately the impugned order was passed by a learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court on 4‑4‑2002 maintaining the earlier orders of the Revenue Authorities, whereby claim of respondent Noor Muhammad a Grow More Food allottee was redressed.
  6. The arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the respondent did not satisfy the requirement of Grow More Food Scheme as he never brought under cultivation 50 per cent. of the area as such he was not eligible for restoration of his earlier lot, is totally devoid of any force. In this regard he has made reference to the report of the audit officer which was totally one‑sided and furthermore even if it be conceded that the respondent did not satisfy the requirement of Grow More Food Scheme it would not be of any help to the petitioner as his initial allotment was totally made in oblivion of the Notification dated 26‑4‑1971. It is also to be appreciated that, the decision of the Member, Board of Revenue dated 8‑5‑1975 was never challenged by the petitioner. He accepted the same and the respondent also waited for two years so as to ensure that his right would be considered under Notification dated 26‑4‑1971. At the cost of repetition the petitioner through manoeuvring secured extension of his lease through the aforesaid order of the Collector dated 24‑9‑1978. In these circumstances we are of the considered view that the orders of the Revenue Authorities which have been maintained by the High Court are unexceptionable and no interference can be made on any ground. Resultantly, this petition is dismissed and leave to appeal is refused.

  In legal terminology the word ""proceedings"" mean the institution or carrying on of an action of law. Generally, a proceeding is the form and manner of conducting judicial business before a Court or Judicial Officer, including all possible steps in an action from its commencement to the execution of a judgment and in a more particular sense, it is any application to a. Court of justice for aid in enforcement of rights for relief, for redress of injuries, or damages or for any remedial object. Proceedings in its general use comprehends every step taken or measure adopted in prosecution or defence of art action.
  The expression ""proceedings"" has not been defined in the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975 but it is a very comprehensive term and generally includes a prescribed course of action for enforcement of a legal right, which would essentially involve the requisite steps by which judicial action is invoked. A ""proceeding"" would include every step taken towards the furtherance of a cause before a Court or a Tribunal where it might be sub judice. It is the step towards the objective to be achieved, say for instance the judgment in a pending suit. The proceedings commence with the first step by which the machinery of law is placed into motion in order to take cognizance of a cause. Proceedings under the repealed laws would appear to commence with the application of a person entitled to the transfer of land out of evacuee pool under the schedule and the schemes framed thereunder. Normally, such application would be disposed of through an order passed by a Competent Authority designated under the law and any person dissatisfied with such order may seek remedy before the appellate and/or revisional forum provided by law.

    JUDGMENT
  RANA BHAGWANDAS, J.--This appeal with the leave of this Court arises out of judgment dated 18-3-1998, passed by a learned Judge in Chambers of the Lahore High Court, Lahore, in Writ Petition No.64-R of 1997 filed by the respondents directing the Chief Settlement Commissioner to allot land measuring 12-1/2 acres anywhere in Punjab, out of the evacuee land, now forming part of the Provincial Government Pool.
  2. Respondents being the legal heirs of Syed Subhan Ali Shah, a displaced person from India filed a writ petition on 31-3-1997 on the averments that their predecessor-in-interest was a displaced person from Hyderabad Deccan and his Claim Form No.6279 was duly verified by the Central Record Room for 17853 P.I. Units. It was the case of the respondents that the said claim was transferred to village Tung, Tehsil, Ferozewala, District Sheikhupura and entered at Khata No.80 of the RL-II Register where an area of 612 Kanals was proposed in the year 1967 against the said claim. It was averred that they have been constantly approaching the local authorities for the confirmation of the said proposal but it did not bear any fruit. They were, however, informed that, on account of floods, most of record of Tehsil Ferozewala was badly damaged and as such entries against the said Khata had been washed away and mutilated to a great extent therefore, it was not possible to give effect to the proposal for allotment according to the respondents during the subsistence of the said proposal the Government issued instructions on 25-6-1973 whereby all such proposal, mere ordered to be cancelled. Relevant memo issued by the Chief Settlement Commissioner was challenged by the affected parties before the Lahore High Court and was finally decided in the case titled ""Mst. Inayat Bibi v. Additional Settlement Commissioner and others on 1-7-1974 reported a PLD 1978 Lahore 252. The Chief Settlement Commissioner also issue, instructions that where a proposal for allotment of rural agricultural land had been made in the Register RL-II and the prescribed period of 15 days in accordance with the provisions contained in para. 68, Part II Chapter-II of the Rehabilitation Supplementary Scheme had elapsed on or before 15-6-1973 when the allotments were stopped such proposal shall be confirmed subject to entitlement. Respondents urged that in view of the memo dated 14-3-1974 issued by the Chief Settlement Commissioner the were entitled to and eligible for confirmation of the proposal of the land but the appellants failed to discharge their statutory obligations and to confirm the proposal in their favour, hence the petition.
  3. In the para-wise comments and departmental report appellants states that entire record of Tehsil Ferozewala was badly damaged during floods, it 1988. Entries of Register RL-II of village Tung were defaced. As per note at Khata No.80 of Register RL-II, 2694 PIUs of M.R.V. Entitlement were transferred to this village on 7-7-1966 but it was illegible as to how much land was proposed for allotment. According to appellants it was evident from the Register of Haqdaran Zamin for the year 1966-67 that neither any land existed in the name of Syed Subhan Ali Shah nor was any land available for allotment which fortified that proposal if any was rescinded at the same time. Deliberate silence and non-persuasion for more than 30 years showed that the claim was transferred and settled elsewhere because the claimant or the respondents did not challenge the rejection of so-called proposal. The proposal, if any, was finalized in the year 1966 and it was not correct that it subsisted till the year 1974. Respondents' case, therefore, did not fall within the preview of the Policy Letter No.312-POL/74, dated 14-3-1974 relied upon by them. Appellants claimed that after more than 30 years' deliberate delay, the respondents had no locus standi or genuine cause to file the petition for resurrection of non-existing proposal.
  4. During the hearing of the petition, learned Judge in Chambers summoned Original, Register RL-II to find out as to whether any proposal was indeed made in the name of the claimant. The officer who produced the register submitted before the Court that entire record of Tehsil Ferozewala had been damaged due to the floods. This register was also found to be in damaged condition and it was not ascertainable from the perusal of Khata No. 80 as to whether some proposal was made in the name of the claimant, through the factum of entering the claim form of the claimant from the said Khata could be deciphered.
  5. Learned Judge in the High Court was of the view that since there was an entry of the claim form of the respondent's predecessor-in-interest in the Register RL-II, it seemed that some steps were being taken for allotment of land but the same could not fructify. On the concession of the respondents counsel that he would not press for a direction for allotment of land measuring 612 Kanals and would be satisfied with the direction for allotment of land to the extent of subsistence holding the petition was allowed and the direction issued as aforesaid leading to this appeal.
  6. Leave to appeal was granted to examine the following questions of law of public importance:
  (i) Whether the High Court could issue direction to allot the land to the respondents when order proposing the land could not be established A from the record?
  (ii) Whether the direction to allot the land could be issued by the High Court in exercise of Constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution after the repeal of Evacuee Laws and also the fact that allotments stood banned since 1974?
  7. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and examined the record with their assistance. Ch. Mushtaq Masood, learned Advocate Supreme Court for the appellants vehemently contended that after the repeal Evacuee and Settlement Laws by virtue of Evacuee Property ant Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act No. XIV of 1975 with effect from 1st July, 1974 respondents could succeed in the petition only if they were able to establish on tile lace of the record that there were pending proceedings before the repeal of laws before any competent Authority with stood transferred to for final disposal to Notified Officer whereas no proceedings were pending in the present case. It was further submitted that the case of the respondents at any event did not fall within the purview of policy decision contained in tire letter, dated 14-3-1974 issued by the Chief Settlement Commissioner in that there was neither a subsisting proposal for allotment of agricultural land in favour of the claimant or the respondents after his demise, nor were respondents in actual and physical possession of the proposed area since Kharif 1971. Learned counsel urged that in the absence of any pending proceedings direction of the High Court after the repeal of Evacuee laws illegal and without jurisdiction. Lastly, impugned judgment was assailed the premise that in any event the High Court could not assume the role Chief Settlement Commissioner by issuing a direction of the nature as in the present case in the exercise of extraordinary Constitutional jurisdiction.
  8. Conversely, Mr. Gul Zarin Kiani, learned counsel for respondents defended the impugned judgment on the grounds that in view existence of a proposal for allotment of land in satisfaction of a verified claim in favour of the claimant and no land having been allotted against the said claim, there were pending proceedings on the date of repeal of Evacuee laws, therefore, the High Court rightly exercised its jurisdiction in order to secure the ends of justice and to redress the wrong. He submitted that respondents had been constantly approaching the relevant authorities for the allotment of land and running from pillar to post for seeking the enforcers of their rights which did not fructify, therefore, they were constrained invoke the Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court as the High Court the custodian of the fundamental rights of the 'citizens Learned Court. Jointed out that the respondents could not be non-suited on the ground aches as the question of delay in approaching the Court of law must examined with reference to the merits of the case. Mr. Kayani, however conceded that the High Court instead of making a direction for allotment and ought to have remanded the case to the Notified Officer consideration of respondents' claim for allotment of land according to law.
  9. In order to determine the right and entitlement of the respondent to seek the allotment of land in satisfaction of the claim and to consider whether he High Court, was possessed of requisite jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition, it is of utmost significance to ascertain whether there were any proceedings pending before an authority appointed under the provisions of Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958 on the date of repeal of the Settlement Laws within the purview of section 2 (2) of Act XIV of 1975, which reads as under:
  ""(2) Upon the repeal of the aforesaid Acts and Regulations, all proceedings which, immediately before such repeal may be pending before the authorities appointed thereunder shall stand transferred for final disposal to such officers as may be notified by the Provincial Government in the official Gazette and all cases decided by the Supreme Court or a High Court after such repeal which would have been remanded to any such authority in the absence of such repeal shall be remanded to the officers notified as aforesaid.""
  10. It is the case of the respondents that notwithstanding the fact that the public record including the record relating to displaced persons' claims and settlement of land had been enundated by heavy floods in Tehsil Ferozewala in 1988 in fact a proposal with regard to settlement of 2694 PIUs in the name of late Syed Sublian Ali Shah existed at Khata No.80 of the RL-II Register. Furthermore, no land in satisfaction of the verified claim of the respondents' predecessor-in-interest had been allotted despite their repeated efforts, therefore, these were pending proceedings before the authorities in the eyes of law. Respondents miry be correct to the extent of saying that there existed an entry in RL-II Register with regard to 2694 PIUs against the verified claim of Syed Subhan Ali Shah, received in the village on 7-7-1966, there is absolutely no evidence to indicate as to the fate of any likely proposal, Obviously it is not known as to whether any land and if so, which Khasra numbers were ever proposed for allotment against the aforesaid claim. Stance of the appellants in the parawise comments that neither the claimant nor the respondents perused their claim for more than three decades would fortify the view that the claim was transferred and settled somewhere else or rejected would not seem to be without any basis. Primarily, it is for the respondents 'to show by concrete evidence that the proposal, if any, for allotment of land remained intact and alive till 1974 when policy decision, vide Circular letter dated 14-3-1974 was made by the Chief Settlement Commissioner. Indeed there is no circumstance to reflect that any land was ever proposed for allotment to the claimant in Tehsil Ferozewala or elsewhere in the District. The circumstance that the respondents and their predecessor-in-interest kept quiet till 1997 would speak volumes about the bona fides and genuineness of their inordinately belated petition. To say the least, their case is completely shrouded in mystery and nothing can be spelt out with an amount of certainty owing to their total inaction, indifference and lack of prosecution. It is difficult to subscribe to the view of the learned counsel that since the claim remained unsatisfied till the repeal of the Evacuee Laws it, would constitute pending proceedings within the purview of the term. Learned counsel relied upon Nawab Din v. Member, Board of Revenue (PLD 1979 SC 846), Government of Punjab v. Muhammad Yaqoob PLD 2002 SC 5 anti Farhatullah Khan v. Additional Commissioner (Revenue) 2002 SCMR 1507).
  11. In Nawab Din's case (supra) it was observed that affixation of word ""all"" before word ""proceedings"" in section 2(2) of Act XIV of 1975 does not authorize exclusion of any type of proceedings from ambit of such word by making a division of kind of judicial proceedings and executive proceedings its long as such proceedings dealt with settlement of land and decided eligibility of an applicant for its transfer. When the words used in the statute are ""all proceedings"" it is not justified to diminish the totality of those proceedings by introducing jurisprudential concepts, for example, judicial proceedings, quasi Judicial proceedings, executive proceedings, administrative proceedings, penal proceedings, fiscal proceedings and proceedings before a Court etc. The focus should remain on the words deployed in the Statute and so long as the proceedings are under the Act repealed; before the competent Authorities; and are of the kind and for the purposes indicted in that Act, for the enforcement of rights mentioned therein on the applicants concerned, they are the proceedings which are saved so as to continue under the relevant law repealed.
  12. In Muhammad Yaqoob's case (supra) there was a definite proposal for allotment of evacuee land and allottee was in possession thereof pursuant to confirmation of the proposal in his favour, which was disputed by the Authorities. In this background, it was observed that the term ""pending proceedings"" as used in the Act, 1975 would mean that an initial step was taken as contemplated under the Settlement laws for allotment of land against verified claim of the claimants but the same did not finalize before the repeal of evacuee laws. Again in Farhatullah Khan's case (supra) respondents had purchased the disputed land from a person whose allotment was set aside by the Authorities. Respondents were seeking protection of section 41 of Transfer of Property Act, 1882. It was in the circumstances observed that any transaction, which was based on fraud could not be sustained in the eyes of law and such transferees were bound to swim or sink alongwith the transferor. Elaborating the issue of ""pending proceedings"" it was held that merely on the basis of inconsumable produce index units, the ease of a claimant could not be treated to be a pending case and if such claimant desired he could ask for compensation from the concerned authorities of the Provincial Government.
  13. There may be no cavil with the proposition of law propounded by this Court in the decided precedents the fact would remain that the respondents utterly failed to demonstrate that except an entry with regard to receipt of a claim concerning 2694 PIUs in favour of their predecessor-in- interest in RL-II Register of village Tung, there was no application, complaint, petition or an actionable cause for satisfaction of claim or allotment of laud pending before an authority appointed under the provisions of repealed laws before the repeal with effect from 1-7-1974. It would thus he unnatural and illogical to hold that simply because in the mutilated and defaced record there appeared an entry with regard to a verified claim, Courts must assume that there were pending proceedings, which could be revived in the writ jurisdiction of the High Court, after the passage of more than three decades. In the absence of any strong documentary or circumstantial evidence tending to substantiate the highly belated claim of the respondents, it would be difficult to hold that the claim of the respondents' predecessor-in-interest remained unconsumed or that they were legally entitled to ask for activating the same after the lapse of more than thirty years without approaching the forums available under the hierarchy of Evacuee Property and Settlement Laws. Judged in the perspective of the decided precedents we are of the firm view that there were no pending proceedings within the ambit of the term used in the abovesaid laws, which could be revived; activated or remanded to a notified Officer as contemplated by the repealing enactment. We are fortified in our view by the dicta of this Court reported as Karim Bibi v. Hussain Bakhsh (PLD 1984 SC 334).
  14. The expression ""proceedings"" has not been defined in the Act XIV of 1975 but it is a very comprehensive term and generally includes a prescribed course of action for enforcement of a legal right, which would essentially involve the requisite steps by which judicial action is invoked. A ""proceedings"" would include every step taken towards the furtherance of a cause before a Court or a Tribunal where it might be sub judice. It is the step towards the objective to be achieved, say for instance the judgment in a pending suit. The proceeding commences with the first step by which the machinery of law is placed into motion in order to take cognizance of a cause. In the light of the abovesaid discussion proceedings under the repealed laws would appear to commence with the application of a person entitled to the transfer of land out of evacuee pool under the schedule and the schemes framed thereunder. Normally, such application would be disposed of trough an order passed by a competent Authority designated under the aw and any person dissatisfied with such order may seek remedy before a appellate and/or revisional forum provided by law. In such a case proceedings remain pending until their final conclusion by the highest authority prescribed under the law.
  15. The expression ""proceedings"" carne up for interpretation before a Full Bench of this Court in The State v. Naeemullah Khan (2001 SCMR 1461) in the context of the term used in section 46 of the Hazara Forest Act, 1936, it was held by, this Court in the precedent case that the word ""proceedings"" is a comprehensive expression which includes every step taken towards further progress of a cause in a Court or Tribunal, from its commencement till its disposal. In legal terminology the word ""proceedings"" mean the institution or carrying on of an action of law. Generally, a proceeding is the form and manner of conducting judicial business before a Court or Judicial Officer, including all possible steps in an action from its commencement to the execution of a judgment and in a more particular sense, it is any application to a Court of justice for aid in enforcement of rights, for relief, for redress of injuries, or damages or for any remedial object. It in its general use comprehends every step taken or measure adopted in ` prosecution or defence of an action. Obviously, in the present case, neither the claimant nor the respondents after his death made any application, complaint or written request before an authority in prosecution of their object at relevant time with a view to obtain the allotment of land in satisfaction of their claim. They remained totally silent and unmoved for more than 30 years and perhaps waited for the emergence of calamity and disaster of heavy floods resulting in destruction of the records. One fails to understand any rationale and logic behind inactive and indifferent attitude of the respondents, who got up from a deep slumber long after the repeal of laws without taking any concrete steps or measures for advancement of their cause which strongly militates against an element of fairness and bona fides on their part. On account of Laches in setting the machinery of law into motion they have indeed disentitled themselves to the exercise of discretionary and equitable jurisdiction, which in all cases must be exercised in order to foster the ends of justice and to right a wrong. Writ jurisdiction is undoubtedly discretionary and extraordinary in nature which may not be invoked by a party who demonstrates a style of slackness and laxity on his part. Furthermore, if a party does not choose legal remedy available under the Statute strictly speaking Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be exercised in his favour. Law is well-settled that a patty guilty of gross negligence and laches is not entitled to the equitable relief. One who seeks equity must show that equities lean in his favour. In the facts and circumstances of the appeal we are, therefore, in no manner of doubt that the High Court was not competent to exercise its writ jurisdiction conferred under Article 199 of the Constitution.
  16. Adverting to the question whether it was an appropriate case for the exercise of writ jurisdiction by the High Court we are clear in our mind that since there were no pending proceedings before the Authorities before the repeal of laws High Court was not legally competent to make any direction. Legally speaking even in a fit and proper case High Court could only remand the case to the relevant authorities for consideration of the right and interest of a person according to law in order to secure the ends of justice, and not to determine the right and entitlement of a person itself. No doubt, discretion conferred on the superior Courts under the Constitution is very wide and extraordinary such discretion is always required to be exercised judiciously and not in an arbitrary manner. It was submitted at the bar that since the High Court had exercised its discretion in favour of the respondents this Court was not bound to interfere with the exercise of discretion. The argument is without any substance and has least impressed us. In our considered opinion High Court did not exercise the discretion vested in it by law in a just and lawful manner, therefore, this Court is under a legal obligation to undo the wrong rather than to act in aid of injustice. Reference to the precedent Wajih-ul-Hassan Zaidi v. Government of Punjab (1997 SCMR 1901) is, therefore, completely misconceived and out of context.
  17. For the aforesaid facts, circumstances and reasons this appeal is allowed, and impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside with no order as to costs.
  M.B.A./M-724/S Appeal allowed.

  ORDER
  JAVED IQBAL, J.‑‑‑This petition for leave to appeal is directed against order dated 30‑10‑2000 whereby Civil Miscellaneous Applications Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 of 1999 in Writ Petition No. 1575‑R of 1977 were dismissed by the learned Single Judge of Lahore High Court, Lahore, in Chambers.
  2. Precisely stated the facts of the case are that the petitioners are owners in Abadi Deh of Village Chaprar and owners of agricultural land in the said village. Ghair Mumkin village Abadi Deh consists of 240 Kanals and 18 Marlas out of which 22 Kanals and 7 Marlas of land was allotted to respondents Nos.3 to 10 with the collusion of Consolidation Authorities which is being used for public purposes. It, however, was cancelled by the Settlement Officer by means of order dated 6‑6‑1974. The respondents Nos.3 to 10 succeeded in getting the said land allotted once again in their favour under Settlement Scheme No.VII dated 13‑6‑1977. The land was got mutated by the respondents in their names with the connivance of local Patwari and Revenue Staff. The illegal entries in Khasra Gardawari were challenged and the learned EAS/Deputy Collector, Sialkot, declared the entries in the names of respondents as illegal. The respondents filed a civil suit for perpetual injunction restraining the petitioners from interfering in the land in question but the same was dismissed. The possession of land is still with the village Abadi Deh and the land is being used for public purposes. The order dated 13‑6‑1977 whereby land in question was allotted in favour of respondents under Settlement Scheme No. VII was assailed by means of Writ Petition No. 1575‑R of 1977 which after admission and grant of status quo resorted by filing the above mentioned civil miscellaneous applications which were also rejected vide order impugned.
  3. We have heard Ch. Hafeez Ahmad, learned Advocate Supreme Court on behalf of petitioners and Dr. Muhammad Akmal Saleemi, learned Advocate Supreme Court for respondents.
  4. The order impugned has been perused carefully and record examined with the eminent assistance of learned counsel. There is no denying the fact that Civil Miscellaneous Application (886 of 1994) was fixed during vacation when general adjournment had been granted to Ch. Hafeez Ahmad, learned Advocate Supreme Court. There is nothing on record to show that Ch. Ameer Hussain, Advocate, was engaged by the legal heirs of Ch. Lal Din who were brought on record due to demise of Ch. Lal Din. In such view of the matters notice should have been given to legal heirs of Ch. Lal Din for fixation of case which was never given as record is silent in this regard. Dr. Muhammad Akmal Saleemi, learned Advocate Supreme Court on behalf of respondents could not. controvert the said position. It is worth mentioning that the writ petition preferred on behalf of petitioners was admitted on 7‑1‑1978 and fixed for regular hearing on 13‑12‑1985, after lapse of seven years but adjourned without any material progress. It was again fixed after seven years on 1‑11‑1992 and dismissed for non‑prosecution. The petitioners moved for its restoration by Civil Miscellaneous Application No.886 of 1994 alongwith an application (Civil Miscellaneous Application No.887 of 1994) for condonation of delay, notice whereof was ‑given to respondents by maintaining status quo. The Civil Miscellaneous Application No.886 of 1994 alongwith application for condonation of delay were fixed after five years on 21‑7‑1999 but dismissed for non prosecution without issuance of fresh notices to the legal heirs of the petitioners.
  5. In view of what has been stated above it can be inferred safely that proper opportunity of hearing was not afforded to petitioners and they were condemned unheard which amounts to miscarriage of justice. The controversy involved valuable rights of the parties which should be decided on merits instead of technicalities specially when the petitioners H have been pursuing their case for the last more than two decades. The impugned order has been passed mainly on the ground that petitioners could not produce plausible justification regarding absence of Ch. Ameer Hussain, Advocate on 21‑7‑1‑999, who was never engaged by the legal heirs were brought on record subsequently. Ch. Hafeez Ahmad, learned Advocate Supreme Court, was granted general adjournment and matter should have not been fixed during vacation without issuance of notice to the legal heirs of the petitioner.
  6. In such view of the matter this petition is converted into appeal and accepted. The Civil Miscellaneous Applications Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of 1999 shall be treated as pending before. the learned High Court and decided in accordance with law and merits after issuance of fresh notices and proper opportunity of hearing to all concerned at the earliest as the matter is pending for the last two decades.
  H.B.T./L‑38/S Order accordingly.

  ORDER
  TANVIR AHMED KHAN, J.‑‑‑Leave to appeal is sought against the judgment dated 26‑6‑2001 whereby a learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court accepted the Constitutional petition bearing N,o.1165 of 1991 filed by respondent No. 1, Ghulam Muhammad.
  2. Facts briefly are that the land measuring 98 Kanals, 15 Marlas was allotted to respondent No.1 under temporary scheme of 15 years in Chak No.4‑D.B. in Tehsil and District Mianwali. The Collector of Mianwali cancelled number of allotments inclusive of respondent No.1 on a general complaint made against them through his order dated 6th of July, 1977. An appeal was filed by respondent No.1 against the order of cancellation which was accepted by the Additional Commissioner through his order dated 10‑1‑1978 and the case was remanded. The learned Member, Board of Revenue upheld the remand order and accordingly the A.C./Collector, Mianwali held in categorical terms that the respondent's allotment was genuine. However, during interregnum period it was allotted to petitioners in C.P. No.2920‑L of 2001 as oustees of Atomic Energy Plant. It was held that in the circumstances respondent No.1 was not entitled to the proprietary rights. (Underlined is ours (sic)).
  3. The respondent challenged this order before the learned Additional Commissioner who dismissed his appeal 'vide order dated (sic) dismissed by the learned Board of Revenue through his order dated 12‑2‑1991. All the afore‑stated orders of the Revenue Authorities were challenged by respondent No.1 through Constitutional Petition No. 1165 of 1991 before the Lahore High Court, Lahore and a learned Single Judge after giving detailed reasons has accepted the same and set aside the orders dated 12‑8‑1987, 7‑5‑1988 and 12‑2‑1991 passed by the Revenue Authorities. Hence this petition for leave to appeal.
  4. We have considered the contentions and have gone through the documents appended with this petition. It is reflected from the perusal thereof that the respondents were allotted disputed land under Fifteen Years Scheme in the year 1971. They were handed over the possession through Rapt No.47 dated 12‑10‑1972. The cancellation was made A through an order dated 6‑7‑1977 by the Deputy Commissioner having no jurisdiction simply on the ground of general complaints. Said order was set aside by the Additional Commissioner and the case was remitted to the Assistant Commissioner/Collector for reconsideration. This remand order was even upheld by the learned Member, Board of Revenue through his order dated 29‑5‑1983.
  5. In the process of remand the Assistant Commissioner with the powers of Collector minutely considered the case of the parties. He came to a definite conclusion that the allotment of the respondent was genuine and valid. This determination has not been even interfered by the learned Member, Board of Revenue. The respondent was simply ousted that subsequently on 2‑12‑1985 the disputed land was allotted to the petitioners under Atomic Energy Oustees Scheme. However, in spite of the said allotment the possession, of the disputed land remained with the respondents. It is also reflected from the record that at the time of issuance of notification entitling the respondents to secure proprietary rights the disputed land was not included in any permanent scheme. The respondent in spite of the fact that his allotment was determined as genuine and valid has been embroiled in uncalled for litigation for the last about three decades. It would be appropriate at this juncture to reproduce the observation of the learned High Court which are as under:‑‑
  "" 10. It is strange that there was no fault of the petitioner, he was locked up in the litigation due to the illegal order passed by the Deputy Commissioner who had no jurisdiction to cancel the lease. He had vested right for the proprietary rights under the policy of respondent which has been denied due to protracted litigation and meanwhile without accepting the legal rights of the petitioner and opportunity of being heard, the land had been illegally included in the Scheme and transferred the same in favour of the respondents.""
  6. Learned counsel for the petitioners have failed to point out any legal infirmity in the impugned judgment warranting interference by this Court. Resultantly these petitions are dismissed and leave refused.
  S.A.K./M‑891/S ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Leave refused.

  ORDER
  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, J.-----This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the judgment dated 11th May, 1999 passed by Lahore High Court, Lahore whereby writ petition filed by petitioners has been dismissed.
  2. Precisely stating the facts of the case are that Ghulam Ghaus alias Ghaus Muhammad father of petitioner was allotted 50 Kanals, 1 Marla land., in Square No. 21, Killa Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in the year 1956 against his claim of 510 PIUs. After the allotment, statedly he sold Killas Nos.1 to 4 whereas Killas Nos.5 and 6 measuring 15 Kanals and 2 Marlas remained with him being part of allotment order. It is alleged that one Fazal Muhammad father of respondents Nos.2, 3, 5 and husband of Mst. Azizan respondent No.4 with the connivance of the Settlement Department got included Killas Nos.5 and 6 in his RL-11 on 3rd November, 1955. According to petitioner's case, there was no such order in favour of Fazal Muhammad, therefore, he illegally got included these Killas numbers in his favour. Petitioners challenged the order dated 3rd November, 1955 before the Settlement Authorities but eventually without success. Therefore, ultimately matter came up before High Court in writ petition, which has been disposed of by means of impugned judgment. As such instant petition has been filed.
  3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner's father was the transferee of Killas Nos.5 and 6 as it has been manifest from the Jamabandi, therefore, Settlement Authority had no jurisdiction to include both the Killa numbers (5 and 6) in RL-II of Fazal Muhammad on 3rd November, 1955.
  4. We have heard the learned counsel for petitioner and have carefully gone through the judgment impugned. Learned High Court had examined the case thoroughly and concluded that as far as Ghulam Ghaus father of petitioner is concerned, he is not in possession of the allotment in respect of Killas Nos . 5 and 6. When we inquired from the learned counsel as to whether he is in possession of the same, he could not answer satisfactorily except saying that in Jamabandi father of petitioners has been shown to be transferee of Killas Nos.5 and 6. We are not inclined to accept the explanation offered by him being unsatisfactory because the Settlement Department after conducting thorough probe came to the conclusion that there is no allotment letter of Killas Nos.5 and. 6 in favour of petitioners.
  5. Because the question of facts has been decided on the basis of material available on record by the Settlement Authority and has been confirmed by all the Courts below, therefore, we are of the opinion that no point is made out for exercise of jurisdiction by this Court under B Article 185(3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
  Thus for the foregoing reasons, we see no force in this petition, as such the same is dismissed and leave declined.

  JUDGMENT
  TANVIR AHMED KHAN, J.---Leave to appeal is sought against the order, dated 12-6-2001 passed by a learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court, Lahore, whereby Civil Revision No.786 of 2001 filed by the petitioners was dismissed maintaining the concurrent findings of the Courts below.
  The brief facts are that the petitioners predecessor-in-interest secured land under Lot No. 185 measuring 1200 Kanals situated in Rakh Dhingana, Tehsil Mankera, District Bhakkar, under Tubewell Scheme introduced by the Thal Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as the Authority). The Authority cancelled the allotment of the above land and resumed the same. The petitioner filed a declaratory suit on 10-4-1991 seeking restoration of his allotment. This plea was contested by the respondents, Issues were framed and .the learned Civil Judge through his judgment, dated 29-10-1995 dismissed .the suit. The petitioners filed an appeal assailing the above judgment, which was dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhakkar, vide his judgment, dated 25-1-2001. The petitioners thereafter preferred Civil Revision No.786 of 2001 before the Lahore High Court, which too met the same fate as it has been dismissed in limine vide order, dated 12-5-2001. Hence, this petition for leave to appeal.
  Learned counsel for the petitioners has pointed out that earlier the petitioner's predecessor-in-interest challenged the cancellation of his allotment through a civil suit in the year 1972, which was dismissed on 21-9-1975. Appeal against the same also met the same fate vide judgment, dated 17-11-1975. However, R.S.A. No. 123 of 1976 filed by the petitioners predecessor-in-interest was accepted by a learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court through his judgment, dated 17-2-1987 holding that the Civil Court had got the jurisdiction. The case was, accordingly, remanded to the trial Court for its disposal. of merits. On this basis, it is argued by the learned counsel that the subsequent suit filed by the successors-in-interest has been dismissed without taking into consideration the remand order.
  We have considered the contentions advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the entire material brought on record with his assistance. It is reflected from the perusal thereof that tile petitioners instead of following the remand order filed a fresh suit on 10-4-1991. The said suit was dismissed by the learned trial Court on merits vide its judgment, dated 29-10-1995 and the appeal and civil revision met the same fate. None of the forums below has non-suited the petitioner on the question of jurisdiction. This being the position, the learned counsel's argument in this respect is totally devoid of any force. Apart from this, it is reflected from the impugned order that the petitioners after the resumption of land withdrew the advance money deposited by them with the Authority. They have not paid any instalment. The resumption order was passed as far back as in the year 1959. The learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court has given cogent reasons for maintaining the concurrent findings of the Courts below. Learned counsel has not pointed out any legal infirmity in the impugned order warranting interference by this Court.
  Resultantly, in view of the foregoing discussion, the instant petition being without any merit is dismissed and leave refused.

  JUDGMENT
  MUNIR A. SHEIKH, J.------This judgment shall dispose of all the above mentioned petitions as the same arise out of a common judgment, involving similar question of law and fact.
  2. These petitions are directed against common judgment of Lahore High Court whereby Constitutional petitions filed by the petitioners have been dismissed. Petitioners were given land in Consolidation Scheme confirmed on 20-6-1990 against land purchased by them measuring 264 Kanals, 11 Marlas through registered sale-deed, dated 17-11-1974 in equal shares. Consolidation Officer, while sanctioning the scheme, at the cost of Abdul Qadir-respondent No.5, allotted the land in excess of the entitlement of the petitioners on account of Beshi to which they were not entitled.
  3. Abdul Qadir-respondent No. 5 feeling aggrieved filed an appeal against the said Consolidation Scheme before the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Consolidation), which was accepted through order, dated , 21-11-1992 and land measuring 27 Kanals, 12 Marlas, allotted to the petitioners in excess of their entitlement on ,account of Beshi was withdrawn from them and given to Abdul Qadir-respondent No.5 as he had been allotted land less than his entitlement.
  4. Petitioners filed separate appeals before the Additional Commissioner (Consolidation) against this order, which were dismissed on 21-4-1993, against which revision petitions filed before the Board of Revenue also failed on 6-10-1999. Constitutional petitions challenging dismissal orders filed by them have been dismissed through the ,impugned judgment against which leave is sought.
  5. Before the High Court it appears that stress of the petitioners mainly was to the effect that at the time of sanction of the scheme Abdul Qadir respondent No.5 did not raise any objection, rather agreed to the allotment of excess land in favour of the petitioners.
  6. This ground was found to be merit less. Learned counsel for the petitioners has not been able to satisfy us that the petitioners were entitled to any land in excess of their entitlement on account of Beshi and finding of fact recorded by all the Courts below suffer from any illegality.
  7. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we find no merit,? in these petitions, which are hereby dismissed and leave to appeal refused.

  JUDGMENT
  MUHAMMAD NAWAZ ABBASI, J.‑‑‑We propose to dispose of abovementioned two civil appeals involving common questions of law and fact, through this common judgment.
  2. Brief facts giving rise to these appeals in the background are that the Rehabilitation Authorities made permanent allotment of land in favour of one Rehmat Ali out of temporary allotment of evacuee land owned by the non- Muslims in Chak No.91/6‑R, District Sahiwal, in the name of Nizam Din and Umer Din son of Fatta as old tenants of Non‑Muslim evacuee. Umer Din preferred a revision petition before the Rehabilitation Commissioner, who vide order dated 25‑6‑1953 directed that Umer Din should be allotted land according to his choice in a compact block from his temporary allotment and in consequence thereto, he was allowed to retain 1‑1/2 killas out of his temporary allotment. Subsequently, one Hashmat Ali challenged the allotments of evacuee lands in the above-said Chak through a revision petition and the then Rehabilitation Commissioner (Mr. I.U. Khan) vide order dated 31‑3. 1955 made the following directions:‑‑
  ""As the evacuee area is limited in this estate, rateable distribution will have to be resorted to. I, however, find that the recommendations of the D.R.C., Montgomery are not in accordance with para. 11, Part II of the Rehabilitation Settlement Scheme I, therefore, send back the case to the D.R.C. with the directions that the allotment in this Chak should be revised, rateable distribution should be made a maximum limit should be prescribed and then allotments made in the light of the instructions given in paragraph 11, Part II of the Rehabilitation Settlement Scheme. These instructions lay down the definite principle that the temporary allotment of a refugee up to a certain limit should not be disturbed if it is covered by the claim form. The first thing, therefore, will be for the Deputy Rehabilitation Commissioner to say what should be this limit which should be between 5 and 8 acres according to the circumstances of this estate.""
  3. The above order passed by the Rehabilitation Commissioner was challenged by Umer Din and others before the Lahore High Court through Writ Petition No.2023‑R of 1962 and a learned Single Judge in the High Court having traced out the history of the case and considered the entitlement of contestants in detail, allowed the writ petition with the following observations:‑‑
  ""The order of the Additional Rehabilitation Commissioner is unsatisfactory for the reason that he has not dealt with the case of each of the petitioners before him. He had held that the order of Mr. I.U. Khan was not implemented to the case at least in respect of respondents Nos.2 and 3. It is possible and even probable that the order was implemented in the case of others also. The Additional Rehabilitation Commissioner should, therefore, have examined each case to see whether the order of Mr. I.U. Khan was implemented or not. It was not open to him to say that confirmation of Agricultural land cannot be quashed, because the order of Mr. I.U. Khan dated the 31st of May, 1955 has remained 'unimplemented. The validity of his order has not been challenged by anyone. It was for him to see that it was implemented, because it was an order passed after notice to the allottees. The case of the petitioners also is that the A.R.C. in making the order, dated the 13th of September, 1961 was implementing the order of Mr. I.U. Khan as clarified by the Deputy Rehabilitation Commissioner. These matters should have been gone into carefully before setting aside the orders of A.R.C. and Deputy Rehabilitation Commissioner. If they cannot be said to have had no jurisdiction in making the order.""
  3. In pursuance of the directions contained in the above judgment of Lahore High Court, the Settlement Commissioner vide order dated 19‑12‑1969 sent the case to Deputy Settlement Commissioner for implementation of the order dated 3,1‑5‑1955 passed by Mr. I.U. Khan. Rehabilitation Commissioner and the Deputy Settlement/Rehabilitation Commissioner vide order dated 21‑8‑1971 disposed of the matter. However, some of the parties being dissatisfied with the order of Deputy Rehabilitation Commissioner filed an appeal which was heard by the A.D.C.(G) iii exercise of his powers as Settlement Commissioner and while maintaining the order passed by the Deputy Settlement/Rehabilitation Commissioner dismissed the appeal. Mst. Aisha Bibi then preferred a revision before the Settlement Commissioner (Land) who while accepting the same vide order dated 29‑12‑1972 directed that Killa No.20/16/25 be restored in the names of its allottee except an area of 2 Kanals which was allowed to be retained by Umer Din. The Settlement Commissioner further directed that Nizam Din would get land equal to 40 units out of the temporary allotment in his possession. The Assistant Commissioner, exercising the powers of Collector/Deputy Settlement Commissioner (Land) in pursuance of the order dated 31‑5‑1955 passed by Mr. LU. Khan, Rehabilitation Commissioner, submitted report for rateable distribution of the disputed area between the parties and in the light of the said report, the Additional Settlement Commissioner disposed of the appeal of Muhammad Ramzan and others vide order dated 23‑7‑1977 which was challenged before the Lahore High Court through Writ Petitions Nos.1031‑R, 1032‑R and 1226‑R of 1977 and a learned Single Judge through a common judgment dated 13‑2‑1993 allowed the writ petitions with the following conclusion:‑‑
  ""4. It is submitted that the learned Additional Commissioner had held that Umar Din son of Fateh Din alias Fatta (petitioner in W.P. No. 1326‑R of 1977), besides three Kanals of land purchased by him from the Central Government (which was now to be counted towards the .satisfaction of his claim of 39 PI Units) should be given two Kanals more out of Khasras Nos. 16 and 25 of Square No. 20. In fact, the area purchased by him was two Kanals nine Marlas. He is a petty claimant and should not be made to suffer the loss of eleven Marlas of land. This position is not controverted by the other side.
  Likewise, it is submitted by Noor Muhammad and others, legal representatives of Dullah (petitioners in W,P. No.1031‑R of 1977) that this Court while deciding Writ Petition No.2023‑R of 1962 directed the cancellation of only two Kanals of land out of Khasras Nos. 16 and 25 of Square No. 26 from their names for the benefit of Umer Din and, therefore, there was no justification for the Additional Settlement Commissioner to cancel any other land of these petitioners allotted to them on 19‑11‑1966 under the orders of the Rehabilitation, Commissioner dated 31‑5‑1955 for the benefit of Nizam Din. It is further submitted that their allotment could be examined qua those who were party in the above writ petition, and while the Additional Settlement Commissioner had upset their allotment for the benefit of respondents 2 to 4 and 6 to 26 (in Writ Petition No. 1031‑R of 1977), in any case, the allotment of 14 Kanals in Khasras Nos. 16 and 25 of Square No.20 should not have been touched. There is force in this contention. This Court while allowing Umar Din son of Fateh Khan alias Fatta to pick up two Kanals of land out of the above‑noted two Khasras had not given direction for cancellation of the remaining 14 Kanals from the names of these petitioners. This land should have been allowed to remain intact with the petitioners. The remaining allotment only should have been subjected to scrutiny.
  Likewise, the, grievances of Nazir Ahmad etc. (petitioners in Writ Petition No. 1032‑R of 1977) have also not been gone into carefully by the learned Additional Settlement Commissioner. .
  5. Resultantly, all these writ petitions are accepted and the impugned order is declared to be without lawful authority. The case is sent back to the A.C./Notified Officer, Sahiwal, who shall hear the parties of these writ petitions and pass fresh orders in accordance with law, keeping in view the observations made hereinbefore.
  6. The parties shall appear before the A.C./Notified Officer, on 6‑3‑1993. The matter shall be finalized within a period of two months.
  7. In order to put an end to this prolonged litigation, learned counsel for the parties have given an undertaking that the parties in these three cases shall deliver possession of the land to the allottees to whom it is finally allotted in consequence of the decision of the A.C./Notified Officer, on or before 15th June, 1993. No costs.""
  Learned counsel for the appellants being dissatisfied with the manner of disposal of the matter by the High Court in the writ petitions and the directions contained therein, filed separate petitions for special leave to appeal before this Court in which leave was granted. The leave granting order, dated 1‑6‑1994, reads as under:‑‑ `
  ""It is stated that allotment of the Evacuee Agricultural and in Chak No.91/6.R, Tehsil and District Sahiwal, was to be made in accordance with the directions given by Mr. I.U. Khan. Rehabilitation Commissioner, which direction had been upheld by the High Court in writ jurisdiction. However, the order of the learned Single Judge has not been kept in mind while passing the said direction. For that reasons his order is not sustainable.
  Leave to appeal is granted to examine the contention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners. During pendency of appeals status quo will be maintained.""
  Learned counsel for the appellants while narrating the facts in the background in detail has contended that the directions contained in the order dated 31‑5‑1955 passed by the Rehabilitation Commissioner and maintained by the High Court vide judgment dated 2‑11‑1965 passed in Writ Petition No.2023‑R of 1962 were allowed to attain the finality which remained un implemented in true prospect. Consequently, the Rehabilitation Commissioner vide order dated 23‑7‑1977 while giving effect to the said orders committed no illegality. In nutshell, the learned counsel submitted that the conclusion drawn by the learned Judge in the High Court in the impugned judgment would amount to recall/review the earlier judgment of the High Court in the abovesaid writ petitions through which the manner of allotment of land determined by the Rehabilitation Commissioner vide order dated 31 5‑1955 was approved.
  Ch. Noor Elahi, learned counsel representing respondents in Civil Appeal No.4$4 of 1994 on the other hand, has contended that the direction given in the judgment of the High Court under challenge was neither in conflict to the order of Rehabilitation Commissioner nor of the judgment in the Writ Petition No.2023‑R of 1962 and consequently the same would not call for interference by this Court.
  The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants in the present appeals is that since the method of allotments of the evacuee land in the Chak in question was not followed in terms of the order of Rehabilitation Commissioner passed in 1955 and the claim of appellants was not satisfied accordingly, therefore, the order dated 29‑7‑1977 passed by the notified officer giving effect to the order dated 31‑5‑1955 was not questionable and the interference of High Court in the matter was not justified. However, the learned counsel has trot been able to convince us that in what context the judgment of the High Court under challenge was in conflict to the earlier judgment delivered in Writ Petition No. 2023‑R of 1962 and how the order dated 27‑5‑1977 passed by the Rehabilitation Commissioner was not in consonance to the directions contained in the said judgment of High Court. This is notable that Rehabilitation Commissioner vide order dated 31‑5‑1955 directed for revising the allotment in the Chak in rateable distribution prescribing a maximum limit in the light of instructions given in paragraph 11, Part II of the West Pakistan Rehabilitation and Settlement Scheme, 1956. The field staff while pooling together all evacuee land without taking into consideration rights of temporary allottees distributed the land amongst the claimants. Under the above Scheme, the claimants were required to be satisfied in the following manner:‑
  (a) The claims of sitting allottees were to be satisfied from their temporary allotment and if claim of such allottees remained unsatisfied fully, the remaining units were to be adjusted from the common pool.
  (b) The surplus land then to be given in satisfaction of the remaining units including the local owners in rateable distribution.
  In pursuance of the order dated 31‑5‑1955 of Rehabilitation Commissioner, the subordinate Rehabilitation Authorities revised the allotment of land in the Chak which led to the litigation between the parties and a number of appeals were filed before the Deputy Rehabilitation Commissioner who disposed of the same vide order dated 22‑11‑1961 and remanded the case to the A.R.C. for fresh scrutiny of the claims of some of the parties. This order of A.R.C. was challenged through separate revision before the Additional Rehabilitation Commissioner who vide order, dated 10th of April, 1962 allowed the revision petitions with the observations that the order of Deputy Rehabilitation Commissioner, for probing the matter in terms of paragraph 11 of Part II of Rehabilitation Settlement Scheme could not be allowed to operate retrospectively and that the order was in contravention of section 13(4) of the Pakistan Rehabilitation Act, 1956.
  The order of Additional Rehabilitation Commissioner having found not satisfactory by the High Court being not in conformity to the order dated 31‑5‑1955 passed by Mr. I.U. Khan, the then Rehabilitation Commissioner, disposed of Writ Petition No. 2023‑R of 1962 vide judgment dated 2‑11‑1965 with direction to the Additional Commissioner to deal with the case of petitioners before him and in the writ petition. .
  The Additional Rehabilitation Commissioner on remand, instead of confining himself to the case of petitioners in Writ Petition No.2023/R of 1962 vide order dated 23‑7‑1977 re‑opened all allotments made in the Chak with the observation that the same were not made in the light of instructions in para. 11, Part II of Rehabilitation and Settlement Scheme, 1956 as directed by Rehabilitation Commissioner in his order dated 31‑5‑1‑955 and once again opened the gate of litigation, therefore, the High Court having attended the grievance of Umer Din son of Fatta, Noor Muhammad and other legal heirs of Dullah and Nazir Ahmed and others petitioners in Writ Petitions Nos. 1326‑R. 1031‑R and 1032‑R of .1977 respectively, concluded that order dated 25‑7‑1977 of Additional Commissioner, impugned in the writ petition caused injustice to them and consequently remanded the case to the notified officer for passing a fresh order in the light of directions contained in the judgment. We have noticed that the parties, through their learned counsel, have given an undertaking before the High Court that the possession of the land would be delivered in consequence to the decision made by the notified officer with the understanding to bring this prolonged litigation to an end.
  It appears that writ petition was disposed of by the High Court with concurrence of the parties and they had no objection for the remand of the case to the notified officer for disposal of the same in terms of the direction contained therein. Keeping in view the nature of dispute between the parties. we find that judgment of the High Court under challenge was neither in conflict to the earlier judgment passed by the High Court in Writ Petition No.2023‑R of 1962 nor the Additional Commissioner was justified to proceed beyond the directions in the said judgment which were confined only to the extent of petitioners in the said petition and re‑opening of the whole matter on the basis of order passed by Rehabilitation Commissioner on 31‑5‑1955 was not justified. This is not ignorable that a lot of changes had taken place in the intervening period, therefore, it would not be proper to allow the parties to enter into fresh litigation once again, after passing half a century. We having considered the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the parties, have come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong with the judgment of the High Court and consequently would not be inclined to interference in the matter:
  For the foregoing reasons we dismiss these appeals with no order as to costs.

      JUDGMENT
  SYED DEEDAR HUSSAIN SHAH, J.‑‑‑Through this common judgment, we intend to dispose of the above appeals, which have arisen out of a consolidated judgment dated 29‑3‑1994 passed by the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, Multan in Writ Petitions Nos.2752‑R of 1976 and 2017‑R of 1976. .
  2. The facts, in brief, are that the disputed land, measuring 80 Kanals, is situated in Chak No.69/EB, Tehsil Rakpattan, then District Sahiwal, out of which 26 Kanals were initially allotted on temporary basis to one Jan Muhammad. Admittedly, after four harvests, Jan Muhammad abandonesd the said land and left for some other village for good. Thereafter, the same land was allotted to the appellants in Civil Appeal No.995 of 1995 on temporary basis. The then Rehablitation Commissioner (Mr. I.U. Khan) vide order dated 11‑11‑1956 directed for revision of allotments in fourteen Chaks (inclusive of Chak No.69/EB) because many underserving persons had succeeded in obtaining allotments. Accordingly, scrutiny of allotments in Chak No.69/EB was carried out, and the land measuring 26 Kanals remained intact in the names of the appellants on the ground that they were sitting allottees. The allotment made in their names was found to be in order. The aforementioned order of Mr. I.U. Khan was challenged before the High Court through a number of writ petitions, which were allowed and the said order was set aside. the parties concerned agitated the matter before this Court, which on 6‑7‑1962, reversed the judgment of the High Court, insofar as the legality of the order of Mr‑. I.U. Khan was concerned, with the result that it stood restored. But, the case of Chak No.69/EB was sent back to the High Court to be decided afresh after hearing all the parties concerned. the High Court decided the matter against the appellants in Civil Appeal No.995 of 1995. Resultantly, they filed civil petition for leave to appeal in this Court, which was ultimately allowed on 18‑11‑1971. Thereafter, an area measuring 80 Kanals and 10 Marlas, non7subject‑matter of the dispute in these appeals, inclusive 'of 26 Kanals, above mentioned, was allotted to the appellants on 19‑7‑1975. the contesting respondents in Civil Appeal No.995 of 1995 set up claim to the entire land measuring 80 Kanals and 10 Marlas, urging that, out of it, land measuring 26 Kanals was initially allotted, to Jan Muhammad, their predecessor-in‑interest, on temporary basis, and they, as his legal heirs, were entitled to its confirmation. To achieve this goal, they tiled an appeal which was partly accepted by the then Additional Commissioner vide order dated 23‑7‑1976, whereby the area measuring 80 Kanals and 10 Marlas was directed to be divided equally between the parties. Thereafter, the appellants tiled Writ Petitions Nos.2017‑R and 2752‑R of 1976, which were dismissed vide impugned judgment dated 29‑3‑1994.
  3. Vide order dated 24‑7‑1995 leave to appeal was granted in both the cases to consider, inter alia, ""whether the impugned order has been passed in disregard of the judgment of Supreme Court dated 28‑10‑1971 (PLD 1972 SC 307) mentioned in paragraph 3 at page 6 of the memorandum of petition for leave to appeal"".
  4. At the very outset, Ch. Noor Ilahi, learned counsel for the appellants . does not want to press Appeal No.995 of 1995, which is dismissed, as not pressed.
  5. Mr. M. Zainul Abidin, learned counsel fir the appellants (in Civil Appeal No.996 of 1995), inter alia, contended that the learned High Court did not consider the case in its proper perspective and the impugned judgment is not sustainable.
  6. We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the appellants and have minutely examined the record. The learned Judge in Chambers did consider all the averments of the parties and we have also gone through ""Naqsha Taqseem"" (available at page 25 of the Paper Book) in which name of Anwar Ali only is mentioned, whereas name of Sardar Ali is not mentioned. There is a finding of fact recorded by Additional Commissioner (Consolidation), Multan Division, Multan (available at page 36 of the Paper Book), that Jan Muhammad predecessor‑in‑interest (the father of Mst. Bashiran the appellant in Appeal No.995 of 1995) was the original allottee of 26 Kanals of land and the respondents were their tenants but on account of death of Jan Muhammad respondents took advantage of the situation because they were minors and manipulated re‑allotment of their temporary allotted property in the name of Anwar Ali and got included Sardar Ali as a family member, without any order from any competent? Rehabilitation Authority and without any notice to Mst. Bashiran and others. This order dated 23‑7‑1976 of Additional Commissioner was challenged before the High Court. It would be pertinent to refer here the relevant paragraphs of the impugned judgment, which read as under:‑‑
  ""5. A perusal of the impugned order shows that respondent No. l has held that the respondents (in W. P. No. 2017 of 1976) were to be: treated as 'original temporary allottees'. In his view, the best course to sort out the controversy was to divide the disputed land equally between the contesting parties.
  6. During the course of arguments, it was pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondents (in W.P. No.2017 of 1976) that, as a matter of fact, the petitioners in the said writ petition did not have any real entitlement to their credit and that they had manoeuvred some bogus verifications in their names. In order to ascertain the factual position, relevant record was summoned from the Central Record Room. It was produced on 15‑12‑1993 and it transpired therefrom that an area measuring 87 Bighas, 4 Biswas each was verified in the names of Anwar Ali and Sardar Ali (petitioners in W.P. No.2017 of 1976) on 8‑7‑1984 on the claim form submitted by their predecessor‑in‑interest Imdad Ali.
  In my view, the impugned order does not merit to be interfered with as it is not only in accordance with law but also equitable. The petitioners in W.P. No.2017 of 1976 could not establish on record their rights over the entire disputed land measuring 80 Kanals, 10 Marlas. Twenty‑six Kanals, undoubtedly, were allotted to them on temporary basis after the same was abandoned by Jan Muhammad in 1949. They can validly set up a claim qua this piece of land only. That is not all. Keeping in view the guidelines mentioned in the order of Mr. I.U. Khan, it was necessary for them to establish that they had an outstanding claim pending satisfaction, available in the Chak before the target date, i.e., 15‑6‑1954. As mentioned above, area measuring 87 Bighas, 3 Biswas each was verified in their names on the strength of claim forms submitted by their predecessor‑in‑interest as late as on 8‑7‑1984. Strictly speaking, this verification could not be availed of by them at all so as to claim even an inch of land in this Chak. They have already been liberally dealt with by respondent No.l by allotment of 14 Kanals over and above 26 Kanals of land which was temporarily allotted to them in 1949. They should feel content therewith. ""
  7. The impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court is based on the proper appreciation of the facts and law laid down by this Court. We do not find jurisdictional error or misconstruction of law, rather the judgment is based on the principles of equity, fair play, and justice. The learned High Court in its wisdom has done complete justice to the parties. The impugned judgment is not open to exception. Appeal No.996 of 1995 is without merit and substance which must fail and the same is hereby dismissed. The parties are left to bear their own costs.

  ORDER
  IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD. CHAUDHRY, J.---This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against judgment dated 18-11-1998 passed by Lahore High Court, Lahore whereby Writ Petition filed by the petitioners has been dismissed.
  2. Precisely stating the facts of the case are that this matter relates to evacuee land initially allotted to one Mallay Khan against his claim at Khata No.4 .of Register R.L. II, , Chak Dulahrey, Tehsil Pasrur, District Sialkot. Subsequently on an application filed under sections 10/11 of the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958 by Ali Muhammad the allotment of the evacuee property was found to have been made in his favour fraudulently against bogus claim, as such it was cancelled by the Deputy Commissioner exercising powers of Additional Settlement Commissioner (L)/Chief Settlement Commissioner, Sialkot vide order dated 16th November, 1968. This order attained finality because it was not interfered by the Chief Settlement Commissioner in exercise of Revisional proceedings instituted on behalf of original allottee. It so happened that meanwhile heirs of Mallay Khan namely Khuda Bakhsh and others sold said land in favour of Khushi Muhammad vide registered sale deed dated 27th August, 1968 who in turn sold it to Muhammad Bashir and his brother son of Jhandey Khan (respondents 2 to 5). On the strength of conveyance so obtained by Muhammad Bashir and others mutation was also effected in their favour. Thereafter Muhammad Bashir filed a civil suit for declaration in the Civil Court wherein declaration was sought that he and his co-sharer are bona fide purchasers of the land. The Civil Court passed ex parte decree on 17th March, 1982 granting relief as it was prayed for.
  3. Petitioners' claim is that they are in cultivating possession of the land in dispute, thereafter, after cancellation of its allotment from the name of Mallay Khan it should have been allotted to them. As such in pursuance of such request the Settlement Authorities were about to concede their claim but in the meanwhile they learnt that respondents Nos. 2 to 5 have obtained decree from the Civil Court. As such petitioners filed an application under section 12(2), C.P.C. for setting aside the ex parte decree on the averments that it had been obtained fraudulently without impleading them as party, as such being void ab initio is of no legal effect. The respondents contested the application.
  4. Learned Civil Judge after framing issues and recording evidence dismissed the application on 28th May, 1989. Against this order petitioners preferred Civil Revision which too was dismissed on 10th March, 1993 by the Additional District Judge, Sialkot. Thereafter the petitioners preferred Writ Petition No.6330 of 1993 in the High Court, which was not pressed to avail the alternative remedy.
  5. In the meantime petitioner Boota and others approached the Member, Board of Revenue (S&R Wing), Punjab, Lahore stating therein that as the allotment of the land from the name of Mallay Khan has been cancelled by DC/Additional Settlement Commissioner, Sialkot vide order dated 16th November, 1968, and that cancellation order has been upheld by the Settlement Commissioner, by order dated 9-2-1977 and this order has attained finality because no one has challenged it, therefore, the land may be resumed and sold to them under section 3 of Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975 as they were in possession of the land. The Secretary (Rural OL), Board of Revenue (S&R Wing) vide memo. No.156'l/83/446, dated 26-7-1983 conveyed the order of the Member, Board of Revenue (S&R Wing)/Chief Settlement Commissioner through which land was ordered to be resumed with direction to consider its sale to petitioners after cancellation of decree of the Civil Court. Respondent Muhanmnad Bashir and others filed Writ Petition No.337-R of 1983 in the Lahore High Court, which was accepted on 26th July, 1983, and case was remanded to Additional Commissioner (Rev)/Settlement Commissioner (Land) with powers of Chief Settlement Commissioner, Gujranwala who vide order dated 19th November, 1994 concluded as under:--
  ""I have considered the submissions made by the counsel of the parties and have perused the record It is admitted fact that the allotment made to Mallay Khan was cancelled by the DC/Additional Settlement Commissioner, Sialkot vide his order dated 16-11-1968, it is also an admitted fact that the order was challenged through declaratory suit in the Civil Court which was decreed on 17-3-1982. That decree was upheld by the Court of District Judge. The contentions of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the decree passed by the Civil Court without jurisdiction should be ignored being Duality in the eyes of law, is not convincing. The decree was passed by the Court of competent jurisdiction. The decree was challenged in the Court of Additional District Judge, but was upheld. I am afraid this tribunal is not competent to declare the decree of the Civil Court null and void. The Board of Revenue in their Memo.No.1567/83/446, dated 26-7-1983 which was impugned in Writ Petition No.337-R of 1983 did not accept the request was to be considered after cancellation of the decree of the Civil Court. As long as the decree of the Civil Court dated 17-3-1982 is in the file no action can be taken on the application of the petitioners. The application is dismissed. ""
  6. The petitioners assailed above order before Lahore High Court by filing Writ Petition No.51-R/1995 which was dismissed by means of impugned judgment dated 18-11-1998. As such instant petition has been filed.
  7. Learned counsel for petitioners vehemently contended that respondents Nos.2 to 5 obtained ex parte decree from Civil Court, dated 17th March, 1982 against the Province of Punjab without impleading the petitioners as party despite the fact that the decree having been passed by a Civil Court without jurisdiction in view of the provisions of section 25 of the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958 will have no adverse reflection on the rights of the petitioners. The respondents Nos.2 to 5 obtained ex parte decree in their favour, dated 17th March, 1982 knowing well that the evacuee land purchased by them was originally allotted on the name of Mallay Khan and the Settlement Authorities had cancelled the allotment from his name on the ground of misrepresentation and fraud. It was further contended that for such reasons respondents Nos.2 to 5 would not be protected by a Civil Court decree which be in nullity in the eye of law deserves to be ignored by this Court.
  8. On the other hand learned counsel for caveators 2 to 5 argued that petitioners have purchased the property from Muhammad Siddique in the year 1980 against value, therefore, being bona fide purchasers from ostensible owner of the land they are entitled to enjoy all the proprietary rights and because a Civil Court decree exists in their favour which has not been set aside despite the fact that the petitioners challenged the same by filing application under section 12(2), C.P.C. as well as before District Judge/Revisional Court, therefore, the Settlement Authorities cannot legally transfer the property in dispute to the petitioners because it is no more available. Thus, for these reasons learned High Court vide impugned judgment has rightly declined to issue writ in favour of petitioners
  8-A. We have heard the learned counsel for both. the sides and have examined instant case from different dimensions and in our opinion following points emerge for consideration:--
  (a) What would be the effect of Civil Court decree, dated 17th March, 1982 obtained by respondents Nos.2 to 5 in view of bar contained under section 25 of the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958 and the principle enunciated by this Court in the cases (1) Muhammad Janul Asghar v. The Improvement Trust, Rawalpindi PLD 1965 SC 698, (2) Habib Khatoon v. Sardar Muhammad PLD 1970 SC 162, (3) Mst. Ghulam Fatima v.

Fazal Khan and another 1997 CLC 1172 and (7) Muhammad Sarwar and 5 others v-. Muhammad Ali and 18 others 2002 SCMR 829,
  (b) As to whether respondents Nos.2 to 5 have obtained ex parte decree from the Civil Court by concealing facts namely that the evacuee land subject-matter of proceedings was , found to have been transferred on the name of Mallay Khan fraudulently/by misrepresentation and the Settlement Commissioner vide order, dated 16th November, 1968 cancelled allotment from his name and this order has been confirmed by the Settlement Commissioner on 9th February, 1969 as the revision filed by legal heirs of Mallay Khan was dismissed?
  (c) What would be the effect of non-implementation of order dated 16th November, 1968?
  (d) As to whether the rights of respondents Nos.2 to 5- will not be protected under section 41 of Transfer of Property Act and the judgments of this Court in the cases of (1) Kanwal Nain and 3 others v. Fateh Khan and others PLD 1983 SC 53, (2) Manzoor Hussain v. Fazal Hussain and others 1984 SCMR 1027, (3) Gul Muhammad and others v. The Additional Settlement Commissioner and others 1985 SCMR 491, (4) Ejaz Ahmad Khan v. Chahat and others 1987 SCMR 192, (5) Mst. Resham Bibi v. Mst. Elahi Sain PLD 1991 SC 1034, and (6) Sufi Zaheer Ahmad (deceased) through Legal Heir v. Chief Settlement and Rehabilitation Commissioner and others 1993 MLD 1952
  (e) As to whether petitioners if found in possession of the evacuee land, subject-matter of proceedings, would not be entitled for its transfer under section 3(2) of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975 or under any Scheme prepared in this behalf by the Government for the transfer of available evacuee land?

JUDGMENT
MUHAMMAD HASHIM KHAN KAKAR, J.---This petition under Article 187(2) read with Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (""the Constitution"") has been filed by Mr. Munir Ahmed Kakar, Member, Balochistan Bar Council and Judicial Commission of Pakistan, seeking implementation of the judgments, passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases of ""Mustafa Impex v. Government of Pakistan"" (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 808) and ""Mahmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan"" (PLD 2013 Supreme Court 195), particularly in relation to the transfers and postings of civil servants and policy decisions taken by the Chief Executive of the Province without approval of the Cabinet.
2. Messrs Mazhar Ilyas Nagi and Munir Ahmed Kakar, contended that though the aforementioned judgments were passed in the year 2012/2016, respectively, and under Articles 129, 130 and 189 of the Constitution, the same are binding upon all the executive authorities and subordinate Courts, yet transfers/postings and policy decision are being made by the respondents in violation of the judgments in question as well as Schedule IV, Rule 22(2) of the Rules of Business Government of Balochistan, 2012. According to them, the Civil Servants are not only facing the menace of terrorism and target killing, but are also confronted with serious issues of governance due to continuous violation of the principles enunciated in the said judgments. To substantiate their point of view, they made a reference to the recent transfers/postings made by the respondents after moving the notice/resolution for a vote of no-confidence against the previous regime. The Deputy Commissioners, District Police Officers and Executive Engineers of those constituencies, members whereof had moved the said resolution for vote of no-confidence, were transferred by the then Chief Minister without consultation with the Chief Secretary, the Services and General Administration Department (S&GAD) and heads of the concerned departments. They further submitted that it is not end of the story, rather after change of the government, the same practice is still going on, which has ruined and lowered the efficiency of the provincial bureaucracy and in this regard, they once again made reference to the immature transfers of Mr. Qamar Masood, Additional Chief Secretary (Development), Mr. Rohail Baloch, Secretary Finance, Mr. Fateh Bangar, Secretary Education, Mr. Pasand Khan Buledi, Secretary Labour and Mr. Javed Shahwani, Secretary Health being made in violation of Schedule IV, Rule 22(2) of the Rules of Business merely on political considerations and pressure of vested groups. While concluding their arguments, they further submitted that the summaries in respect of the aforesaid officers, prepared by the Secretary S&GAD would show that their transfers have been made on political considerations.
3. On the contrary, Mr. Rauf Atta, learned Advocate General, while not feeling himself in a position to refute the said contentions, feebly challenged the maintainability of the instant petition in view of the bar, contained in Article 212 of the Constitution, as the matter pertains to the terms and conditions of service. He also contended that the powers under Article 187 can only be exercised by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan and this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a petition under the said provision of the Constitution. While concluding his arguments, he further submitted that under Section 10 of the Balochistan Civil Servants Act, 1974, every Civil Servant is required to serve anywhere within or outside the Province of Balochistan, in any post under the Federal Government, or any Provincial Government or Local Authority, or a Corporation or Body setup or established by any such Government.
4. So far as the contention of learned Advocate General regarding maintainability of the instant petition is concerned, we are not persuaded to agree with such contention for the following reasons:
i. firstly, the petitioner, who does not fall within the definition of civil servant, as defined in Section 2(b) of the Balochistan Civil Servants Act, 1974, shall have no remedy before the Services Tribunal, functioning under Article 212 of the Constitution and he would be free to avail appropriate remedy. There is no cavil to the proposition that under Section 4 of the Balochistan Civil Servants Act, 1974, every civil servant shall hold office during the pleasure of the Government and, similarly, Section 10 thereof explicitly provides that every civil servant shall be liable to serve anywhere within or outside the Province of Balochistan in any post under the Federal Government, or any Provincial Government or Local Authority, or Corporation or Body setup or established by any Government, however, in the instant case, neither the aforesaid officials have refused to perform their duties, nor have they approached this Court for reversal of their transfer orders, rather the petitioner, who is representative of the legal fraternity, has approached this Court in the larger interest of general public;
ii. secondly, there is no cavil to the proposition that the ambit and scope of the power of High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution is not as wide, as of the Supreme Court under Article 187 of the Constitution to pass any order or issue any direction or decrees for doing ""complete justice"" and it is also true that the Constitution makers conferred powers to issue such directions, orders, or decrees may be necessary for doing complete justice only to the Hon'ble Supreme Court and not to the High Court, however, in the instant case, the petitioner is not asking to determine/decide rights of civil servants itself, but has sought the implementation of the aforementioned judgments and issuance of directions to the respondents to act in accordance with law. According to our humble opinion, in addition to jurisdiction under Article 199(1)(c) of the Constitution to issue directions to any person including Government, this Court may also under Article 187(2) of the Constitution 1973 direct implementation of orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan. In this regard, reference can be made to the cases of ""Khushi Muhammad v. Inspector General of Police Punjab"" (1999 SCMR 2868) and ""Amanullah Khan Yousafzai v. Federation of Pakistan"" (PLD 2011 Karachi 451);
iii. thirdly, under Articles 189 and 190 of the Constitution, law declared by the Supreme Court becomes law of the land and is binding not only on all Courts in Pakistan, but also on all organs of the State and there is no escape from acceptance, obedience, or compliance of an order passed by the Supreme Court, which is the final and the highest Court in the country and no one can be allowed to violate the same, while taking shelter behind technicalities. It would also be pertinent to mention here that effect of the Supreme Court judgment cannot be eroded or nullified through any executive or administrative instrumentality and it is by now settled that even legislature cannot destroy, annul, set aside, vacate, reverse or modify a final judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction. In this regard reference can be made to the cases of ""Mir Alam Gul v. Ismail"", (PLD 1990 SC 926), ""Ashiq Hussain v. the State"" (PLD 1994 SC 879), ""Province of the Puniab v. Haji Yaqoob Khan"", (2007 SCMR 554), ""Syed Sajjad Hussain v. Secretary, Establisbment Division Cabinet Secretariat Islamabad"", (1996 SCMR 284), ""Abdul Waheed v. Mst. Ramzanu"", (2006 SCMR 489) and ""Sh. Muhammad Rafique Goreja v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan"" PLD 2006 SC 66 and
iv. fourthly, to enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law is the inalienable right of every citizen and denial of vested right having accrued in favour of any party would justify issuance of directions by High Court under constitutional jurisdiction to set right the wrong. This Court under Article 199(1)(c) of the Constitution has ample jurisdiction to give directions to public functionaries to act strictly in accordance with law in view of Article 4 of the constitution. It is by now settled that when a statutory functionary acts mala fide or in a partial, unjust and oppressive manner, High Court, in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction, has ample power to grant relief to the aggrieved party. In this regard, references can be made to the cases of ""Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. v. Director General Mines and Minerals"" (PLD 2011 Quetta 1), ""Brig. Muhammad Bashir v. Abdul Karim (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 271)"" and ""Pakcom Limited v. Federation of Pakistan"" (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 44).
5. Reverting to merits of the case, it may be stated that public servants are always considered to be the backbone of a country and a capable and motivated bureaucracy has always played an instrumental role in the economic growth and overall prosperity in many countries. After independence, we inherited a strong bureaucracy having the capacity and capability to take decisions in the larger public interest and resist extraneous pressures and influences, while on the contrary, the political institutions were weak, as such, a tug of war started between the bureaucracy and the politicians and in order to tame the bureaucracy, political interference was started. Public servants as the name suggests are servant of the public and not the ruling government. Almost all the laws referring to civil servants resort to definition given in section 21 of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 (P.P.C.), however, after emergence of the Pakistan, the situation changed overnight due to political interference in public service. This phenomenon was also noticed by the father of the nation, who, while addressing a batch of civil servants at Peshawar in April 1948, advised the civil servants in the following words:
""The reason why I am meeting you is that I wanted to say a few words to you who are occupying very important positions in the administration of this province. The first thing that I want to tell you is that you should never be influenced by any political pressure, by any political party or any individual politician. If you want to raise the prestige and greatness of Pakistan you must not fall victim to any pressure but do your duty as servants of the people and the state, fearlessly and honestly. The services are the backbone of the State. Governments are formed. Governments are defeated. Prime Ministers come and go, ministers come and go, but you stay on. Therefore, there is a very great responsibility placed on your shoulders. You should have no hand in supporting this political party or that political party, this political leader or that political leader. This is not your business.""
The situation further deteriorated in early seventies, when serious attack was made on bureaucracy's neutrality and more than 1300 senior bureaucrats were compulsorily retired and administrative reforms were introduced, while removing their constitutional protection. Such reforms not only undermined the bureaucracy, but put it on fast track towards complete impotency and compromises.
7. In order to cope up with the situation, tending to facilitate expeditious disposal of Government business and to meet the convenience and requirement of the public, in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 139 read with Article 129 of the Constitution, ""the Balochistan Government Rules of Business, 2012."" were framed and Rule 22(1) thereof reads as under:
""22.(I) Transfers of officers shown in column 2 of Schedule III shall be made by the authorities shown in column 3 thereof or specified by the Government from time to time;
(2) The Services and General Administration Department shall be consulted if it is proposed to:
(a) transfer the holder of a tenure post before the completion of his tenure or extend his period of tenure:
(b) require an officer of BPS-17 and above to hold charge of more than one post for a period exceeding three months.
Note- Tenure of posts shown in column I of Schedule IV shall be as shown in column 2 thereof.
Similarly Schedule III of the Rules of Business, 2012 reads as follows:

8.
Officials upto the rank of Superintendent:-

8. Keeping in view the continuous violation of the Rules of Business and frequent transfers/postings on political and extraneous considerations, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of ""Mahmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan"" (PLD 2013 SC 195), commonly known as Ms. Anita Turab's case, held as under:
""(i) Appointments, Removals and Promotions: Appointments, removals and promotions must be competent made in accordance with the law and the rules made thereunder; where no such law or rule exists and the matter has been left to discretion, such discretion must be exercised in a structured, transparent and reasonable manner and in the public interest.
(ii) Tenure, posting and transfer: When the ordinary tenure for a posting has been specified in the law or rules made thereunder, such tenure must be respected and cannot be varied, except for compelling reasons, which should be recorded in writing and are judicially reviewable.
(iii) Illegal orders: Civil servants owe their first and foremost allegiance to the law and the Constitution. They are not bound to obey orders from superiors which are illegal or are not in accordance with accepted practices and rules based norms; instead in such situations, they must record their opinion and, if necessary, dissent.
(iv) OSD: Officers should not be posted as OSD except for compelling reasons, which must be recorded in writing and are judicially reviewable. If at all an officer is to be posted as OSD, such posting should be for the minimum period possible and if there is a disciplinary inquiry going on against him, such inquiry must be completed at the earliest.""
9. It is also worth mentioning that in pursuance of the aforesaid guidelines, the then Chief Secretary Balochistan issued Notification No.SO(Judl:) 790/ S&GAD/2012/1218-1368 dated 13th December, 2012; operative part whereof reads as under:
""All concerned are directed to strictly follow the relevant law, rules, regulations and policies issued by the Government time to time dealing with the above referred matters of civil servants. Moreover, above guidelines/instructions set forth by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan must be implemented in letter and spirit. The failure of a state functionary to apply a legal principle which is clearly and unambiguously attracted to a case may expose him to contempt proceedings under Article 204(2)(a) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan.""
10. Mr. Mazhar Ilyas Nagi contended that though the judgment in question was passed in the year 2012 and under Articles 129, 130 and 189 of the Constitution, the same is binding upon all the executive authorities of the Province as well as subordinate Courts, yet transfers and postings are being made by the respondents in violation of the judgment in question, notification issued by the then Chief Secretary as well as Schedule IV, Rule 22(2) of the Rules of Business, 2012. During the course of hearing, we were informed that the respondents in derogation of the Rules of Business are running the affairs of the government and making transfers postings according to the provisions of Notification No.S.O.(R-1)-3(9)/2012 S&GAD/2016-2215 dated July 17, 2012, whereby Ministers incharge have been declared as authority for postings/transfers of employees in BPS-I 7 and below and the Chief Minister in case BPS-1 8 and above. The said notification goes to contrary to the Rules of Business, 2012 and it is not a statutory instrument and having no force of law. Such notification cannot be issued in derogation of Rules of Business, framed in exercise of power under Article 139. In exercise of these powers, Ministers have been frequently transferring employees almost on monthly and sometimes on weekly basis. The said notification has been issued in supersession of notification No.S.O.(R-1)-3(9)S&GAD/2011/2846-2946 dated 2nd November, 2011 and it has no value being contrary to the Rules of Business of 2012. Such notification cannot hold the field for a moment being contrary to the law and no transfers/postings could be made in violation of the Rules of Business. While holding such view, we are fortified from the well celebrated judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of ""Mustafa Impex Karachi v. Government of Pakistan"" (PLD 2016 SC 808), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:
""Following the Rules of Business, 1973 was mandatory and binding on the Government and a failure to follow them would lead to an order lacking any legal validity. Framer of rules was as much bound by the content thereof as anyone else was subject thereto. Constitutionally mandated rules (such as the Rules of Business, 1973) were closely intertwined with the concept of good governance for and in the public interest. Allowing a departure therefrom would be detrimental to open and transparent forms of governance. To allow the Executive to depart from the language of the Rules of Business, 1973 in its discretion would be to permit, and legitimize, unconstitutional executive actions.""
11. The moot questions, which require to be answered are as to whether the Minister has power to post or transfer any officer or whether such powers can be granted to him being not permitted by the rules? Before answering the said questions and dilating upon the rival contentions of the parties, it would be appropriate and advantageous to reproduce herein below Rule 6(1) and Rule 8(1) and (2) of the Rules of Business, 2012, which lay down, the functions of the Provincial Minister and the Secretary:
""6. Functions of the Minister and Advisors.
(1) Minister. A Minister shall:
(a) be responsible of policy matters and for the conduct of business of his Department; Provided that in important political, economic or administrative matters, the Minister shall consult the Chief Minister.
(b) submit cases to the Chief Minister through Chief Secretary as required by the provisions of these rules;
(c) keep the Chief Minister informed of any important case disposed of by him without reference to the Chief Minister; and
(d) conduct the Business relating to his Department in Assembly;
""8. (1). ""A Secretary shall:
(a) assist the Minister in formulation of policy and bring to the notice of the Minster cases which are required to be submitted to the Chief Minister under the rules;
(b)) duly execute the sanctioned policy;
(c) be the official head of the Department and be responsible for its efficient administration and discipline, and for the proper conduct of business assigned to the department under rule 3;
(d) submit all proposals for legislation to the Cabinet with a approval of the Minister;
(e) be responsible to the Minister for the proper conduct of the business of the department and keep him informed about the working of the department and of any important cases disposed of without reference to the Minister;
(f) keep the Chief Secretary informed of important cases disposed of in the Department;
(g) where the Minister's orders appear to involve a departure from rules, regulations or Government policy, resubmit case to the Minister inviting his attention to the relevant rules, regulations or Government policy and if the Minister still disagrees with a Secretary, the Minister shall refer the case to the Chief Minister through Chief Secretary for orders;
(h) subject to any general or special orders of the Government, issue orders specifying the cases or class of cases which may be disposed of by an officer subordinate to the Secretary; and
(i) be responsible for the careful observance of these rules in his Department;
2. While submitting a case for the orders of the Minister, it shall be duty of the Secretary to suggest a definite line of action.""
12. A bare perusal of the aforementioned rules would show that the functions of Minister and Secretary are altogether different. The Minister only attends to policy matters and conducts the business relating to his department in the provincial assembly; whereas, the administration of the department vests in the departmental hierarchy acting through the Secretary. His position is at the apex of the department, any attempt, therefore, to sideline or marginalize Secretary or to circumvent him or to otherwise curtail his powers directly or indirectly would be contrary to law and of no legal effect. Besides, assisting the Minister in formulation of policy, the Secretary being official head of the department, is responsible for its efficient administration and discipline, and for the proper conduct of business assigned to the Department under rule 3. In such view of the matter, we are of the considered view that the Minister has nothing to do with the transfers/postings of civil servants and the Notification dated July 17, 2012, whereby the powers of transfers/ postings were assigned to the Minister, is absolutely illegal, void ab initio. The said Notification is not only against the principle of Delegatus non potest delegare but is also runs against the Rules of Business, 2012. While holding this view we are fortified from the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of ""Khan Muhammad v. The Chief Secretary Government of Balochistan"" (Civil Petition No.2812 of 2017), wherein the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qazi Faez Isa, speaking for the Court, observed as under:
""We therefore have no hesitation to hold that the notification of February 3, 2014 to the extent of item 12 (reproduced in paragraph 5 above) which grants the Minister the power to post/transfer a civil servant is ultra sires the Rules and the scheme of governance envisaged in the Constitution and therefore is of no legal effect. Needless to state that if there are similar notifications or powers granted to ministers with regard to the posting/transfer of civil servants at any other department which negate the Rules and the scheme of governance envisaged in the Constitution those would also be of no legal effect.""
13. It is pertinent to observe that in view of the Government Servants Conduct Rules, 1979; a public servant stands restrained from approaching a legislator. Similarly, a government servant cannot take part in political activities nor supposed to use political influence because it amounts to misconduct, as defined in Rule 2(1)(f) of the Balochistan (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1992. For the sake of ready reference, the said rule is reproduced hereunder:
2(1).""No Government servant shall, directly or indirectly, approach any Member of the National Assembly or a Provincial Assembly or any other non-official person to intervene on his behalf in any matter.""
Unfortunately, contrary to said rule, through the Notification dated 17th July, 2012 the power of transfer/posting has been entrusted to Minister, which compelled the government servants to have relations and affiliation with the political parties, with the result, some of the employees have been nominated/elected as members of central committees etc. of various political parties. This unhealthy practice and unfortunate situation has adversely affected the smooth running of official business and also paved a way for them to have lucrative and excellent position, irrespective of their capability, competency and entitlement. Similarly, the frequent transfer/posting of revenue staff/officers i.e. Sub-Registrars, Assistant Collectors, Settlement Officers, MBRs and Sr.MBR, who discharged Judicial functions under the revenue laws, by or at the instance of Revenue Minister seriously affects the judicial functions sought to be discharged by them, besides leaving far reaching adverse implication and impacts on revenue decisions, lowering the confidence of the people on judicial system.
14. Our attention was also invited towards the statement of the then Chief Secretary, viz: Saifullah Chatta recorded before the Quetta Commission, comprising of his lordship Mr. Justice Qazi Faez lsa, Judge of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, relevant part whereof reads as under:
""Previously the Chief Secretary used to make all posting orders except those of Secretaries and Commissioners which was done by the CM in consultation with the Chief Secretary. The system has now been compromised by giving the authority to the CM. The reasons I say that the Chief Secretary would better make such postings is because the Chief Secretary would always adhere to the stipulated duration of the tenure which is to be between 2 to 3 years in a particular post, however, as now the discretion vests in the CM he does not observe the minimum tenure. In addition to this the Minister of a department has the power to post any one in his department from grade 1 to grade 17 which has completely undermined the authority of the Secretary of the Department. The Ministers also do not observe this minimum tenure requirement. At times Ministers and CM are directly approached by the bureaucrats for a particular posting which is completely against the rules. This too did not happen previously. The Ministers and Chief Minster are required to be responsible for policy, however, the implementation of such policies and to run the administrative units should be the responsibility of the Secretary and Chief Secretary.
As regards the Divisions, which are headed by Commissioners, this system has also been completely destroyed. In this regard previously the Commissioner used to post the Assistant Commissioner who in turn used to post the Naib Tehsildar, Kanoongoh. Patwari and all other postings upto grade 14, and the Deputy Commissioner would make postings within his District from grade I to grade 16. Now all this is done by the Ministers which is completely unsatisfactory. This new concentrated all the administrative powers in the hands of Ministers which is a very bad development. The Minister's power should be restricted to policy matters whereas the administrative powers in the tier mechanism of Commissioners, Secretaries and Chief Secretary. The prevalent system also has another dimension; the bureaucrats are made accountable when things go wrong, including being summoned to court and the Ministers are not so exposed despite the fact that it was the Minister who had made the posting but the blame has to be taken by the Chief Secretary, Secretary, Commissioner and other officers.""
15. After going through a number of Summaries produced by the Secretary S&GAD during the course of hearing, we have painfully observed that it has become a routine practice on the part of civil servants to approach the concerned Minister, MPAs, MNAs and Senators for getting postings against lucrative posts and even such facts have been mentioned in some of the Summaries. It is shocking to observe that no resistance was shown by the Offices of concerned Secretaries, Secretary S&GAD and Chief Secretary. Needless to observe that such conduct on the part of civil servants tantamount to misconduct, which can entail severe departmental action against them.
16. We are mindful of the fact that the postings and transfers are within the competence of the authorities and neither a particular posting can be sought nor asked for by a Government servant and similarly, under section 10 of the Act of 1974, every civil servant is liable to serve anywhere within or outside the province of Balochistan but the said provision of law does not state that a civil servant can be posted or transferred by disregarding his seniority and tenure of post that too without assigning any reason. It also must not escape notice that such discretion cannot be exercised in an arbitrary or fanciful manner, but judiciously and in accordance with the settled norms of justice, equity and fair play. It is the bounden duty of the authority that, while exercising such discretion, the requirement of job, nature of duties, requisite capabilities and know-how for its performance, qualification of the incumbent, seniority position, general reputation and ACRs must be considered, because the previous service should be free from blemish. Reference can be made to the case of ""Shah Nawaz Marri v. Government of Balochistan"" (2000 PLC (C.S.) 533), the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:
""While agreeing with the reasoning and conclusion as arrived at by his Lordship, the Honourable Chief Justice, I would also like to give my humble view. I am conscious of the fact that neither a particular posting can be sought nor asked for by a Government servant, but it does not mean that the concept of O.S.D. having its own peculiar characteristics should be exploited. A Government Servant, who is posted as O.S.D. had every legitimate right to ask for the reasons about such posting specially when his juniors are having lucrative and excellent posting. I am also conscious of the fact that posting of a particular Government Servant against a Particular post is discretionary and falls within the prerogative domain of Government, but it must not escape unnoticed that such discretion cannot be exercised in an arbitrary and fanciful manner but judiciously and in accordance with settled norms of justice, equity and fair play. It is bounden duty of the Government that while exercising such discretion the requirement of job, nature of duties, requisite capabilities and know-how for its performance, qualification of the incumbent, seniority position, general reputation and A.C.Rs. must be considered because the previous service should be free from blemish ""
17. It may be stated that under Rule 22(2) Schedule IV of the Rules of Business 2012, the posts of Additional Chief Secretary, Chairman CMIT, Members Board of Revenue (MBR), Secretaries, Additional Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries, Section Officers, Head of attached departments are declared to be Tenure Posts and a period for transfer of the same is fixed for three years, however, due to political pressure and consideration, frequently transfers and postings are being made. According to learned amicus curiae, even non-fixing of tenure does not clothe the government with a power to transfer civil servants frequently at its whims and wishes without adhering to law. In this regard, reference can be made to the case of ""Zahid Akhter v. Government of Puniab"" (PLD 1995 SC 530), wherein it was held:
""The normal period of posting of government servant at a station according to the above-referred policy decision of the Government, is three years which has to be followed in the ordinary circumstances unless for the reasons of exigencies of services mentioned in the aforesaid policy of Government, a transfer before expiry of three years period becomes necessary in the opinion of the competent Authority"".
18. This Court is cognizant of the fact that each case pertaining to the terms and condition of the service of the civil servants have its own facts/merits and cannot be treated in the same manner with a single yardstick and strict adherence to the tenure of posting in every case is not possible, however, 'normal period of three years has to be followed in the ordinary circumstances'. The competent authority can make premature transfer of a civil servant, if satisfied that the transfer involves appointment to higher service or post carrying high emoluments, being made to a post for which the officer has special aptitude, qualification or experience, the officer has proved unsuitable in the post from which he is being transferred, holding a lien, he become available or transfer is on compassionate grounds.
19. We are in agreement with learned amicus curie that all sorts of transfer/posting orders are sought to be justified in the name of ""public interest"" without comprehending the implications thereof. We are afraid that as per SI.No.2(3) of the Esta Code (Chapter-Ill), every Civil Servant is required to be served with three-month notice prior to his proposed transfer from one station to another to enable him to plan his affairs, however, he can be transferred without prior notice only in the case of exigencies both natural and human induced disaster and public interest. In order to avoid such notice and to justify illegal, immature and frequent transfers on political consideration, it has become a routine practice to use the phraseology of ""public interest"" and every summary purported such wording.
20. The record of postings/transfers made by the government of Balochistan through the S&GAD, during the last two years reveals that in most of the cases tenure was not observed. Many junior officers have been posted against higher positions rendering senior surplus. Senior officers, who are not ready to obey illegal orders of their political bosses have been pin ponged by continuous postings. They are neither given duties nor postings at any of the places and in this regard the learned amicus curiae made a reference to the notification No.SA/111-1-1(25)/ 2018-S&GAD dated 9th April 2018, whereby in order to frustrate the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in Anita Turab's case, the Provincial Government has accorded sanction to the creation of 15 temporary posts of Members (B-21/13-20) in Chief Minister Inspection Team (CMIT) for adjustment of the following officers, awaiting posting in the S&GAD for a long time:
""i) Mr. Muhammad Hashan Tareen (PAS/BS-2I
ii) Mr. Mather. Niaz Rana (PAS/BS-2I)
iii) Mr. Akhter Muhammad Kakar (BCS/BS-21)
iv) Mr. Umar Khan Babar (BCS/BS-20)
v) Mr. Noor Muhammad Jogezai (BCS/BS-20)
vi) Mr. Bashir Ahmed Bangulzai (BCS-BS-20)
vii) Mr. Shahid Saleem Qureshi (BCS/BS-20/0ffg:)
viii) Mr. Eazaz Aslam Dar (PAS/BS-20)
ix) Mr. Taseer Jamal Alizai (PAS/BS-20)
x) Mr. Naseer Khan Kashani (PAS/BS-20)
xi) Mr. Sher Yar Taj (PAS/BS-20)
xii) Mr. Ali Gul Kurd (BSS/BS-20)
xiii) Mr. Riaz Ahmed (BSS/BS-20)
xiv) Mr. Zahid Saleen (BSS/BS-20)""
21. In order to improve governance, it is necessary that independent, impartial and professional status of the civil service as an institution is restored. The civil servants, being backbone of the system, have to be protected against injustices particularly political victimization enabling them to deliver to the best of their abilities without any fear or favour. They have to be reassured that they are not subservient to the political executives and are under obligation to remain compliant with the Constitution and law. We have painfully observed that most of the transfers have been made on the verbal directions of the high ups and summaries thereof have subsequently been submitted for obtaining the approval/confirmation are just a formality and were completely devoid of any meaningful discussion about merits/demerits of the decision taken in haste. It appears that notification of postings/transfers without due process of deliberations is the root cause of poor governance. Had the concerned Department been given the chance to process the proposals properly before formal notification, many bad decisions could have been averted. It is therefore, imperative that the prevailing practice of notification of postings/transfers on verbal orders of the high ups is stopped immediately and instead the system of submission of self-contained summaries is made mandatory for an informed/appropriate decision by the competent authority. The summaries so moved must include the information i.e. title and grade of the post to be filled, grade and cadre of the officers eligible for posting there against [Relevant Service Rules], Particulars of officers proposed to be transferred/posted, [grade/cadre should match with the prescribed eligibility criteria], tenure of the officer to be shuffled, profile card of officers in the panel, performance evaluation reports of officers in the panel and status of inquiries and NAB/corruption cases, if any, against the officers in the panel. Similarly, in case of administrative secretaries and equivalent, commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners a panel of 3 officers shall be suggested for selection of the most suitable one for the position intended to be filled. Same principle shall be applied for posting of heads of attached Departments, to be made by the S&GAD as provided in the Balochistan Government Rules of Business, 2012. In exceptional cases where posting of a junior officer against a senior post or premature transfer is inevitable, prior endorsement from a committee led by the Chief Secretary with ACS (Dev), SMBR, Secretary S&GAD, Law and Home Departments as members shall be mandatory. The committee members shall be personally responsible about the soundness of the proposal. Proper record of the deliberations shall be maintained and produced as and when required.
22. It is also worth mentioning that premature and frequent transfer/posting is also a burden on the government exchequer and heavy amount is incurred under the head of TA/DA. Similarly, due to political reasons, the posting of junior officers against the higher grades creates uncertainty and heartburning among the senior officers. Though in this regard a decision was taken by the Provincial Cabinet and Regulation-1 dated 12th March 2003 was also issued by the Services and General Administration Department, but the same has never been acted upon, the regulation reads as under:
""The Cabinet decided that in order to streamline the posting and transfer policy the following measures be adopted:-
i) Pre-mature posting/transfers is a burden on the Government exchequer and heavy amount is incurred under the head of T.A/D.A, therefore, it should be avoided.
ii) Posting/transfer in Home district should be discouraged/not allowed.
iii) Junior officer should not be posted against higher grade posts as it creates uncertainty amongst the senior officers.
iv) Frequent posting/ transfer should be avoided
v) A reasonable tenure of posting at a station may be fixed i.e. at least two years.
vi) All postings/transfers should be processed as per laid down Rules/procedures.""
23. For the discussion made hereinabove, the petition is allowed and the same is disposed of in the following terms:
i. that no transfers/postings of civil servants shall be made in violation of the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Anita Turab and the judgment should be implemented in letter and spirit;

JUDGMENT
MUHAMMAD HASHIM KHAN KAKAR, J.---This petition under Article 187(2) read with Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (""the Constitution"") has been filed by Mr. Munir Ahmed Kakar, Member, Balochistan Bar Council and Judicial Commission of Pakistan, seeking implementation of the judgments, passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases of ""Mustafa Impex v. Government of Pakistan"" (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 808) and ""Mahmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan"" (PLD 2013 Supreme Court 195), particularly in relation to the transfers and postings of civil servants and policy decisions taken by the Chief Executive of the Province without approval of the Cabinet.
2. Messrs Mazhar Ilyas Nagi and Munir Ahmed Kakar, contended that though the aforementioned judgments were passed in the year 2012/2016, respectively, and under Articles 129, 130 and 189 of the Constitution, the same are binding upon all the executive authorities and subordinate Courts, yet transfers/postings and policy decision are being made by the respondents in violation of the judgments in question as well as Schedule IV, Rule 22(2) of the Rules of Business Government of Balochistan, 2012. According to them, the Civil Servants are not only facing the menace of terrorism and target killing, but are also confronted with serious issues of governance due to continuous violation of the principles enunciated in the said judgments. To substantiate their point of view, they made a reference to the recent transfers/postings made by the respondents after moving the notice/resolution for a vote of no-confidence against the previous regime. The Deputy Commissioners, District Police Officers and Executive Engineers of those constituencies, members whereof had moved the said resolution for vote of no-confidence, were transferred by the then Chief Minister without consultation with the Chief Secretary, the Services and General Administration Department (S&GAD) and heads of the concerned departments. They further submitted that it is not end of the story, rather after change of the government, the same practice is still going on, which has ruined and lowered the efficiency of the provincial bureaucracy and in this regard, they once again made reference to the immature transfers of Mr. Qamar Masood, Additional Chief Secretary (Development), Mr. Rohail Baloch, Secretary Finance, Mr. Fateh Bangar, Secretary Education, Mr. Pasand Khan Buledi, Secretary Labour and Mr. Javed Shahwani, Secretary Health being made in violation of Schedule IV, Rule 22(2) of the Rules of Business merely on political considerations and pressure of vested groups. While concluding their arguments, they further submitted that the summaries in respect of the aforesaid officers, prepared by the Secretary S&GAD would show that their transfers have been made on political considerations.
3. On the contrary, Mr. Rauf Atta, learned Advocate General, while not feeling himself in a position to refute the said contentions, feebly challenged the maintainability of the instant petition in view of the bar, contained in Article 212 of the Constitution, as the matter pertains to the terms and conditions of service. He also contended that the powers under Article 187 can only be exercised by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan and this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a petition under the said provision of the Constitution. While concluding his arguments, he further submitted that under Section 10 of the Balochistan Civil Servants Act, 1974, every Civil Servant is required to serve anywhere within or outside the Province of Balochistan, in any post under the Federal Government, or any Provincial Government or Local Authority, or a Corporation or Body setup or established by any such Government.
4. So far as the contention of learned Advocate General regarding maintainability of the instant petition is concerned, we are not persuaded to agree with such contention for the following reasons:
i. firstly, the petitioner, who does not fall within the definition of civil servant, as defined in Section 2(b) of the Balochistan Civil Servants Act, 1974, shall have no remedy before the Services Tribunal, functioning under Article 212 of the Constitution and he would be free to avail appropriate remedy. There is no cavil to the proposition that under Section 4 of the Balochistan Civil Servants Act, 1974, every civil servant shall hold office during the pleasure of the Government and, similarly, Section 10 thereof explicitly provides that every civil servant shall be liable to serve anywhere within or outside the Province of Balochistan in any post under the Federal Government, or any Provincial Government or Local Authority, or Corporation or Body setup or established by any Government, however, in the instant case, neither the aforesaid officials have refused to perform their duties, nor have they approached this Court for reversal of their transfer orders, rather the petitioner, who is representative of the legal fraternity, has approached this Court in the larger interest of general public;
ii. secondly, there is no cavil to the proposition that the ambit and scope of the power of High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution is not as wide, as of the Supreme Court under Article 187 of the Constitution to pass any order or issue any direction or decrees for doing ""complete justice"" and it is also true that the Constitution makers conferred powers to issue such directions, orders, or decrees may be necessary for doing complete justice only to the Hon'ble Supreme Court and not to the High Court, however, in the instant case, the petitioner is not asking to determine/decide rights of civil servants itself, but has sought the implementation of the aforementioned judgments and issuance of directions to the respondents to act in accordance with law. According to our humble opinion, in addition to jurisdiction under Article 199(1)(c) of the Constitution to issue directions to any person including Government, this Court may also under Article 187(2) of the Constitution 1973 direct implementation of orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan. In this regard, reference can be made to the cases of ""Khushi Muhammad v. Inspector General of Police Punjab"" (1999 SCMR 2868) and ""Amanullah Khan Yousafzai v. Federation of Pakistan"" (PLD 2011 Karachi 451);
iii. thirdly, under Articles 189 and 190 of the Constitution, law declared by the Supreme Court becomes law of the land and is binding not only on all Courts in Pakistan, but also on all organs of the State and there is no escape from acceptance, obedience, or compliance of an order passed by the Supreme Court, which is the final and the highest Court in the country and no one can be allowed to violate the same, while taking shelter behind technicalities. It would also be pertinent to mention here that effect of the Supreme Court judgment cannot be eroded or nullified through any executive or administrative instrumentality and it is by now settled that even legislature cannot destroy, annul, set aside, vacate, reverse or modify a final judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction. In this regard reference can be made to the cases of ""Mir Alam Gul v. Ismail"", (PLD 1990 SC 926), ""Ashiq Hussain v. The State"" (PLD 1994 SC 879), ""Province of the Punjab v. Haji Yaqoob Khan"", (2007 SCMR 554), ""Syed Sajjad Hussain v. Secretary, Establishment Division Cabinet Secretariat Islamabad"", (1996 SCMR 284), ""Abdul Waheed v. Mst. Ramzanu"", (2006 SCMR 489) and ""Sh. Muhammad Rafique Goreja v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan"" (PLD 2006 SC 66) and
iv. fourthly, to enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law is the inalienable right of every citizen and denial of vested right having accrued in favour of any party would justify issuance of directions by High Court under constitutional jurisdiction to set right the wrong. This Court under Article 199(1)(c) of the Constitution has ample jurisdiction to give directions to public functionaries to act strictly in accordance with law in view of Article 4 of the constitution. It is by now settled that when a statutory functionary acts mala fide or in a partial, unjust and oppressive manner, High Court, in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction, has ample power to grant relief to the aggrieved party. In this regard, references can be made to the cases of ""Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. v. Director General Mines and Minerals"" (PLD 2011 Quetta 1), ""Brig. Muhammad Bashir v. Abdul Karim (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 271)"" and ""Pakcom Limited v. Federation of Pakistan"" (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 44).
5. Reverting to merits of the case, it may be stated that public servants are always considered to be the backbone of a country and a capable and motivated bureaucracy has always played an instrumental role in the economic growth and overall prosperity in many countries. After independence, we inherited a strong bureaucracy having the capacity and capability to take decisions in the larger public interest and resist extraneous pressures and influences, while on the contrary, the political institutions were weak, as such, a tug of war started between the bureaucracy and the politicians and in order to tame the bureaucracy, political interference was started. Public servants as the name suggests are servant of the public and not the ruling government. Almost all the laws referring to civil servants resort to definition given in section 21 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (P.P.C.), however, after emergence of the Pakistan, the situation changed overnight due to political interference in public service. This phenomenon was also noticed by the father of the nation, who, while addressing a batch of civil servants at Peshawar in April 1948, advised the civil servants in the following words:
""The reason why I am meeting you is that I wanted to say a few words to you who are occupying very important positions in the administration of this province. The first thing that I want to tell you is that you should never be influenced by any political pressure, by any political party or any individual politician. If you want to raise the prestige and greatness of Pakistan you must not fall victim to any pressure but do your duty as servants of the people and the state, fearlessly and honestly. The services are the backbone of the State. Governments are formed. Governments are defeated. Prime Ministers come and go, ministers come and go, but you stay on. Therefore, there is a very great responsibility placed on your shoulders. You should have no hand in supporting this political party or that political party, this political leader or that political leader. This is not your business.""
6. The situation further deteriorated in early seventies, when serious attack was made on bureaucracy's neutrality and more than 1300 senior bureaucrats were compulsorily retired and administrative reforms were introduced, while removing their constitutional protection. Such reforms not only undermined the bureaucracy, but put it on fast track towards complete impotency and compromises.
7. In order to cope up with the situation, tending to facilitate expeditious disposal of Government business and to meet the convenience and requirement of the public, in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 139 read with Article 129 of the Constitution, ""the Balochistan Government Rules of Business, 2012."" were framed and Rule 22(1) thereof reads as under:
""22.(I) Transfers of officers shown in column 2 of Schedule III shall be made by the authorities shown in column 3 thereof or specified by the Government from time to time;
(2) The Services and General Administration Department shall be consulted if it is proposed to:
(a) transfer the holder of a tenure post before the completion of his tenure or extend his period of tenure:
(b) require an officer of BPS-17 and above to hold charge of more than one post for a period exceeding three months.
Note- Tenure of posts shown in column I of Schedule IV shall be as shown in column 2 thereof.
Similarly Schedule III of the Rules of Business, 2012 reads as follows:

8.
Officials upto the rank of Superintendent:-

8. Keeping in view the continuous violation of the Rules of Business and frequent transfers/postings on political and extraneous considerations, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of ""Mahmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan"" (PLD 2013 SC 195), commonly known as Ms. Anita Turab's case, held as under:
""(i) Appointments, Removals and Promotions: Appointments, removals and promotions must be competent made in accordance with the law and the rules made thereunder; where no such law or rule exists and the matter has been left to discretion, such discretion must be exercised in a structured, transparent and reasonable manner and in the public interest.
(ii) Tenure, posting and transfer: When the ordinary tenure for a posting has been specified in the law or rules made thereunder, such tenure must be respected and cannot be varied, except for compelling reasons, which should be recorded in writing and are judicially reviewable.
(iii) Illegal orders: Civil servants owe their first and foremost allegiance to the law and the Constitution. They are not bound to obey orders from superiors which are illegal or are not in accordance with accepted practices and rules based norms; instead in such situations, they must record their opinion and, if necessary, dissent.
(iv) OSD: Officers should not be posted as OSD except for compelling reasons, which must be recorded in writing and are judicially reviewable. If at all an officer is to be posted as OSD, such posting should be for the minimum period possible and if there is a disciplinary inquiry going on against him, such inquiry must be completed at the earliest.""
9. It is also worth mentioning that in pursuance of the aforesaid guidelines, the then Chief Secretary Balochistan issued Notification No.SO(Judl:) 790/ S&GAD/2012/1218-1368 dated 13th December, 2012; operative part whereof reads as under:
""All concerned are directed to strictly follow the relevant law, rules, regulations and policies issued by the Government time to time dealing with the above referred matters of civil servants. Moreover, above guidelines/instructions set forth by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan must be implemented in letter and spirit. The failure of a state functionary to apply a legal principle which is clearly and unambiguously attracted to a case may expose him to contempt proceedings under Article 204(2)(a) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan.""
10. Mr. Mazhar Ilyas Nagi contended that though the judgment in question was passed in the year 2012 and under Articles 129, 130 and 189 of the Constitution, the same is binding upon all the executive authorities of the Province as well as subordinate Courts, yet transfers and postings are being made by the respondents in violation of the judgment in question, notification issued by the then Chief Secretary as well as Schedule IV, Rule 22(2) of the Rules of Business, 2012. During the course of hearing, we were informed that the respondents in derogation of the Rules of Business are running the affairs of the government and making transfers postings according to the provisions of Notification No.S.O.(R-1)-3(9)/2012 S&GAD/2016-2215 dated July 17, 2012, whereby Ministers incharge have been declared as authority for postings/transfers of employees in BPS-17 and below and the Chief Minister in case BPS-1 8 and above. The said notification goes to contrary to the Rules of Business, 2012 and it is not a statutory instrument and having no force of law. Such notification cannot be issued in derogation of Rules of Business, framed in exercise of power under Article 139. In exercise of these powers, Ministers have been frequently transferring employees almost on monthly and sometimes on weekly basis. The said notification has been issued in supersession of Notification No.S.O.(R-1)-3(9)S&GAD/2011/2846-2946 dated 2nd November, 2011 and it has no value being contrary to the Rules of Business of 2012. Such notification cannot hold the field for a moment being contrary to the law and no transfers/postings could be made in violation of the Rules of Business. While holding such view, we are fortified from the well celebrated judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of ""Mustafa Impex Karachi v. Government of Pakistan"" (PLD 2016 SC 808), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:
""Following the Rules of Business, 1973 was mandatory and binding on the Government and a failure to follow them would lead to an order lacking any legal validity. Framer of rules was as much bound by the content thereof as anyone else was subject thereto. Constitutionally mandated rules (such as the Rules of Business, 1973) were closely intertwined with the concept of good governance for and in the public interest. Allowing a departure therefrom would be detrimental to open and transparent forms of governance. To allow the Executive to depart from the language of the Rules of Business, 1973 in its discretion would be to permit, and legitimize, unconstitutional executive actions.""
11. The moot questions, which require to be answered are as to whether the Minister has power to post or transfer any officer or whether such powers can be granted to him being not permitted by the rules? Before answering the said questions and dilating upon the rival contentions of the parties, it would be appropriate and advantageous to reproduce herein below Rule 6(1) and Rule 8(1) and (2) of the Rules of Business, 2012, which lay down, the functions of the Provincial Minister and the Secretary:
""6. Functions of the Minister and Advisors.
(1) Minister. A Minister shall:
(a) be responsible of policy matters and for the conduct of business of his Department; Provided that in important political, economic or administrative matters, the Minister shall consult the Chief Minister.
(b) submit cases to the Chief Minister through Chief Secretary as required by the provisions of these rules;
(c) keep the Chief Minister informed of any important case disposed of by him without reference to the Chief Minister; and
(d) conduct the Business relating to his Department in Assembly;
""8. (1). ""A Secretary shall:
(a) assist the Minister in formulation of policy and bring to the notice of the Minster cases which are required to be submitted to the Chief Minister under the rules;
(b)) duly execute the sanctioned policy;
(c) be the official head of the Department and be responsible for its efficient administration and discipline, and for the proper conduct of business assigned to the department under rule 3;
(d) submit all proposals for legislation to the Cabinet with a approval of the Minister;
(e) be responsible to the Minister for the proper conduct of the business of the department and keep him informed about the working of the department and of any important cases disposed of without reference to the Minister;
(f) keep the Chief Secretary informed of important cases disposed of in the Department;
(g) where the Minister's orders appear to involve a departure from rules, regulations or Government policy, resubmit case to the Minister inviting his attention to the relevant rules, regulations or Government policy and if the Minister still disagrees with a Secretary, the Minister shall refer the case to the Chief Minister through Chief Secretary for orders;
(h) subject to any general or special orders of the Government, issue orders specifying the cases or class of cases which may be disposed of by an officer subordinate to the Secretary; and
(i) be responsible for the careful observance of these rules in his Department;
2. While submitting a case for the orders of the Minister, it shall be duty of the Secretary to suggest a definite line of action.""
12. A bare perusal of the aforementioned rules would show that the functions of Minister and Secretary are altogether different. The Minister only attends to policy matters and conducts the business relating to his department in the provincial assembly; whereas, the administration of the department vests in the departmental hierarchy acting through the Secretary. His position is at the apex of the department, any attempt, therefore, to sideline or marginalize Secretary or to circumvent him or to otherwise curtail his powers directly or indirectly would be contrary to law and of no legal effect. Besides, assisting the Minister in formulation of policy, the Secretary being official head of the department, is responsible for its efficient administration and discipline, and for the proper conduct of business assigned to the Department under rule 3. In such view of the matter, we are of the considered view that the Minister has nothing to do with the transfers/postings of civil servants and the Notification dated July 17, 2012, whereby the powers of transfers/ postings were assigned to the Minister, is absolutely illegal, void ab initio. The said Notification is not only against the principle of Delegatus non potest delegare but is also runs against the Rules of Business, 2012. While holding this view we are fortified from the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of ""Khan Muhammad v. The Chief Secretary Government of Balochistan"" (Civil Petition No.2812 of 2017), wherein the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qazi Faez Isa, speaking for the Court, observed as under:
""We therefore have no hesitation to hold that the notification of February 3, 2014 to the extent of item 12 (reproduced in paragraph 5 above) which grants the Minister the power to post/transfer a civil servant is ultra sires the Rules and the scheme of governance envisaged in the Constitution and therefore is of no legal effect. Needless to state that if there are similar notifications or powers granted to ministers with regard to the posting/transfer of civil servants at any other department which negate the Rules and the scheme of governance envisaged in the Constitution those would also be of no legal effect.""
13. It is pertinent to observe that in view of the Government Servants Conduct Rules, 1979; a public servant stands restrained from approaching a legislator. Similarly, a government servant cannot take part in political activities nor supposed to use political influence because it amounts to misconduct, as defined in Rule 2(1)(f) of the Balochistan (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1992. For the sake of ready reference, the said rule is reproduced hereunder:
2(1).""No Government servant shall, directly or indirectly, approach any Member of the National Assembly or a Provincial Assembly or any other non-official person to intervene on his behalf in any matter.""
Unfortunately, contrary to said rule, through the Notification dated 17th July, 2012 the power of transfer/posting has been entrusted to Minister, which compelled the government servants to have relations and affiliation with the political parties, with the result, some of the employees have been nominated/elected as members of central committees etc. of various political parties. This unhealthy practice and unfortunate situation has adversely affected the smooth running of official business and also paved a way for them to have lucrative and excellent position, irrespective of their capability, competency and entitlement. Similarly, the frequent transfer/posting of revenue staff/officers i.e. Sub-Registrars, Assistant Collectors, Settlement Officers, MBRs and Sr.MBR, who discharged Judicial functions under the revenue laws, by or at the instance of Revenue Minister seriously affects the judicial functions sought to be discharged by them, besides leaving far reaching adverse implication and impacts on revenue decisions, lowering the confidence of the people on judicial system.
14. Our attention was also invited towards the statement of the then Chief Secretary, viz: Saifullah Chatta recorded before the Quetta Commission, comprising of his lordship Mr. Justice Qazi Faez lsa, Judge of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, relevant part whereof reads as under:
""Previously the Chief Secretary used to make all posting orders except those of Secretaries and Commissioners which was done by the CM in consultation with the Chief Secretary. The system has now been compromised by giving the authority to the CM. The reasons I say that the Chief Secretary would better make such postings is because the Chief Secretary would always adhere to the stipulated duration of the tenure which is to be between 2 to 3 years in a particular post, however, as now the discretion vests in the CM he does not observe the minimum tenure. In addition to this the Minister of a department has the power to post any one in his department from grade 1 to grade 17 which has completely undermined the authority of the Secretary of the Department. The Ministers also do not observe this minimum tenure requirement. At times Ministers and CM are directly approached by the bureaucrats for a particular posting which is completely against the rules. This too did not happen previously. The Ministers and Chief Minster are required to be responsible for policy, however, the implementation of such policies and to run the administrative units should be the responsibility of the Secretary and Chief Secretary.
As regards the Divisions, which are headed by Commissioners, this system has also been completely destroyed. In this regard previously the Commissioner used to post the Assistant Commissioner who in turn used to post the Naib Tehsildar, Kanoongoh. Patwari and all other postings upto grade 14, and the Deputy Commissioner would make postings within his District from grade I to grade 16. Now all this is done by the Ministers which is completely unsatisfactory. This new concentrated all the administrative powers in the hands of Ministers which is a very bad development. The Minister's power should be restricted to policy matters whereas and the administrative powers in the tier mechanism of Commissioners, Secretaries and Chief Secretary. The prevalent system also has another dimension; the bureaucrats are made accountable when things go wrong, including being summoned to court and the Ministers are not so exposed despite the fact that it was the Minister who had made the posting but the blame has to be taken by the Chief Secretary, Secretary, Commissioner and other officers.""
15. After going through a number of Summaries produced by the Secretary S&GAD during the course of hearing, we have painfully observed that it has become a routine practice on the part of civil servants to approach the concerned Minister, MPAs, MNAs and Senators for getting postings against lucrative posts and even such facts have been mentioned in some of the Summaries. It is shocking to observe that no resistance was shown by the Offices of concerned Secretaries, Secretary S&GAD and Chief Secretary. Needless to observe that such conduct on the part of civil servants tantamount to misconduct, which can entail severe departmental action against them.
16. We are mindful of the fact that the postings and transfers are within the competence of the authorities and neither a particular posting can be sought nor asked for by a Government servant and similarly, under section 10 of the Act of 1974, every civil servant is liable to serve anywhere within or outside the province of Balochistan but the said provision of law does not state that a civil servant can be posted or transferred by disregarding his seniority and tenure of post that too without assigning any reason. It also must not escape notice that such discretion cannot be exercised in an arbitrary or fanciful manner, but judiciously and in accordance with the settled norms of justice, equity and fair play. It is the bounden duty of the authority that, while exercising such discretion, the requirement of job, nature of duties, requisite capabilities and know-how for its performance, qualification of the incumbent, seniority position, general reputation and ACRs must be considered, because the previous service should be free from blemish. Reference can be made to the case of ""Shah Nawaz Marri v. Government of Balochistan"" (2000 PLC (C.S.) 533), the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:
""While agreeing with the reasoning and conclusion as arrived at by his Lordship, the Honourable Chief Justice, I would also like to give my humble view. I am conscious of the fact that neither a particular posting can be sought nor asked for by a Government servant, but it does not mean that the concept of O.S.D. having its own peculiar characteristics should be exploited. A Government Servant, who is posted as O.S.D. had every legitimate right to ask for the reasons about such posting specially when his juniors are having lucrative and excellent posting. I am also conscious of the fact that posting of a particular Government Servant against a Particular post is discretionary and falls within the prerogative domain of Government, but it must not escape unnoticed that such discretion cannot be exercised in an arbitrary and fanciful manner but judiciously and in accordance with settled norms of justice, equity and fair play. It is bounden duty of the Government that while exercising such discretion the requirement of job, nature of duties, requisite capabilities and know-how for its performance, qualification of the incumbent, seniority position, general reputation and A.C.Rs. must be considered because the previous service should be free from blemish ""
17. It may be stated that under Rule 22(2) Schedule IV of the Rules of Business 2012, the posts of Additional Chief Secretary, Chairman CMIT, Members Board of Revenue (MBR), Secretaries, Additional Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries, Section Officers, Head of attached departments are declared to be Tenure Posts and a period for transfer of the same is fixed for three years, however, due to political pressure and consideration, frequently transfers and postings are being made. According to learned amicus curiae, even non-fixing of tenure does not clothe the government with a power to transfer civil servants frequently at its whims and wishes without adhering to law. In this regard, reference can be made to the case of ""Zahid Akhter v. Government of Puniab"" (PLD 1995 SC 530), wherein it was held:
""The normal period of posting of government servant at a station according to the above-referred policy decision of the Government, is three years which has to be followed in the ordinary circumstances unless for the reasons of exigencies of services mentioned in the aforesaid policy of Government, a transfer before expiry of three years period becomes necessary in the opinion of the competent Authority"".
18. This Court is cognizant of the fact that each case pertaining to the terms and condition of the service of the civil servants have its own facts/merits and cannot be treated in the same manner with a single yardstick and strict adherence to the tenure of posting in every case is not possible, however, 'normal period of three years has to be followed in the ordinary circumstances'. The competent authority can make premature transfer of a civil servant, if satisfied that the transfer involves appointment to higher service or post carrying high emoluments, being made to a post for which the officer has special aptitude, qualification or experience, the officer has proved unsuitable in the post from which he is being transferred, holding a lien, he become available or transfer is on compassionate grounds.
19. We are in agreement with learned amicus curie that all sorts of transfer/posting orders are sought to be justified in the name of ""public interest"" without comprehending the implications thereof. We are afraid that as per SI.No.2(3) of the Esta Code (Chapter-III), every Civil Servant is required to be served with three-month notice prior to his proposed transfer from one station to another to enable him to plan his affairs, however, he can be transferred without prior notice only in the case of exigencies both natural and human induced disaster and public interest. In order to avoid such notice and to justify illegal, immature and frequent transfers on political consideration, it has become a routine practice to use the phraseology of ""public interest"" and every summary purported such wording.
20. The record of postings/transfers made by the government of Balochistan through the S&GAD, during the last two years reveals that in most of the cases tenure was not observed. Many junior officers have been posted against higher positions rendering senior surplus. Senior officers, who are not ready to obey illegal orders of their political bosses have been pin ponged by continuous postings. They are neither given duties nor postings at any of the places and in this regard the learned amicus curiae made a reference to the Notification No.S-VIII-1-1(25)/ 2018-S&GAD dated 9th April 2018, whereby in order to frustrate the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in Anita Turab's case, the Provincial Government has accorded sanction to the creation of 15 temporary posts of Members (B-21/B-20) in Chief Minister Inspection Team (CMIT) for adjustment of the following officers, awaiting posting in the S&GAD for a long time:
""i) Mr. Muhammad Hashan Tareen (PAS/BS-21)
ii) Mr. Mather Niaz Rana (PAS/BS-21)
iii) Mr. Akhter Muhammad Kakar (BCS/BS-21)
iv) Mr. Umar Khan Babar (BCS/BS-20)
v) Mr. Noor Muhammad Jogezai (BCS/BS-20)
vi) Mr. Bashir Ahmed Bangulzai (BCS/BS-20)
vii) Mr. Shahid Saleem Qureshi (BCS/BS-20/0ffg:)
viii) Mr. Eazaz Aslam Dar (PAS/BS-20)
ix) Mr. Taseer Jamal Alizai (PAS/BS-20)
x) Mr. Naseer Khan Kashani (PAS/BS-20)
xi) Mr. Sher Yar Taj (PAS/BS-20)
xii) Mr. Ali Gul Kurd (BSS/BS-20)
xiii) Mr. Riaz Ahmed (BSS/BS-20)
xiv) Mr. Zahid Saleem (BSS/BS-20)""
21. In order to improve governance, it is necessary that independent, impartial and professional status of the civil service as an institution is restored. The civil servants, being backbone of the system, have to be protected against injustices particularly political victimization enabling them to deliver to the best of their abilities without any fear or favour. They have to be reassured that they are not subservient to the political executives and are under obligation to remain compliant with the Constitution and law. We have painfully observed that most of the transfers have been made on the verbal directions of the high ups and summaries thereof have subsequently been submitted for obtaining the approval/confirmation are just a formality and were completely devoid of any meaningful discussion about merits/demerits of the decision taken in haste. It appears that notification of postings/transfers without due process of deliberations is the root cause of poor governance. Had the concerned Department been given the chance to process the proposals properly before formal notification, many bad decisions could have been averted. It is therefore, imperative that the prevailing practice of notification of postings/transfers on verbal orders of the high ups is stopped immediately and instead the system of submission of self-contained summaries is made mandatory for an informed/appropriate decision by the competent authority. The summaries so moved must include the information i.e. title and grade of the post to be filled, grade and cadre of the officers eligible for posting there against [Relevant Service Rules], Particulars of officers proposed to be transferred/posted, [grade/cadre should match with the prescribed eligibility criteria], tenure of the officer to be shuffled, profile card of officers in the panel, performance evaluation reports of officers in the panel and status of inquiries and NAB/corruption cases, if any, against the officers in the panel. Similarly, in case of administrative secretaries and equivalent, commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners a panel of 3 officers shall be suggested for selection of the most suitable one for the position intended to be filled. Same principle shall be applied for posting of heads of attached Departments, to be made by the S&GAD as provided in the Balochistan Government Rules of Business, 2012. In exceptional cases where posting of a junior officer against a senior post or premature transfer is inevitable, prior endorsement from a committee led by the Chief Secretary with ACS (Dev), SMBR, Secretary S&GAD, Law and Home Departments as members shall be mandatory. The committee members shall be personally responsible about the soundness of the proposal. Proper record of the deliberations shall be maintained and produced as and when required.
22. It is also worth mentioning that premature and frequent transfer/posting is also a burden on the government exchequer and heavy amount is incurred under the head of TA/DA. Similarly, due to political reasons, the posting of junior officers against the higher grades creates uncertainty and heartburning among the senior officers. Though in this regard a decision was taken by the Provincial Cabinet and Regulation-1 dated 12th March 2003 was also issued by the Services and General Administration Department, but the same has never been acted upon, the regulation reads as under:
""The Cabinet decided that in order to streamline the posting and transfer policy the following measures be adopted:-
i) Pre-mature posting/transfers is a burden on the Government exchequer and heavy amount is incurred under the head of T.A/D.A, therefore, it should be avoided.
ii) Posting/transfer in Home district should be discouraged/not allowed.
iii) Junior officer should not be posted against higher grade posts as it creates uncertainty amongst the senior officers.
iv) Frequent posting/ transfer should be avoided
v) A reasonable tenure of posting at a station may be fixed i.e. at least two years.
vi) All postings/transfers should be processed as per laid down Rules/procedures.""
23. For the discussion made hereinabove, the petition is allowed and the same is disposed of in the following terms:
i. that no transfers/postings of civil servants shall be made in violation of the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Anita Turab and the judgment should be implemented in letter and spirit;
ii. no transfer and posting order on verbal direction of the competent authority shall be issued, in such a situation Rule 9(4) of the Balochistan Rules of Business, 2012 shall be followed;
iii. the administrative Secretary while submitting summary/note to the competent authority for transfer and posting of any officer, provision of Rule 22(2) of the Balochistan Government Rules of Business, 2012 should be strictly followed;
iv. the Notification dated July 17, 2012 to the extent of empowering the Ministers to post and transfer a civil servant is ultra vires the Rules and scheme of governance envisaged in the Constitution and therefore is of no legal effect;
v. in view of the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Khan Muhammad, if there are similar notifications or powers granted to Minister with regard to posting/transfer of civil servants in any other department which negate the rules, would also be of no legal effect;
vi. the summaries so moved must include the information i.e. title and grade of the posts to be filled, grade and cadre of the officers eligible for posting there against [Relevant Service Rules], particular of officers proposed to be transferred/posted, [grade/cadre should match with the prescribed eligibility criteria], tenure of the officer to be shuffled, profile card of officers in the panel, performance evaluation reports of officers in the panel and status of inquiries and NAB corruption cases, if any, against the officers in the panel.
vii. in case of Administrative Secretaries and a equivalent, Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners a panel of three officers shall be suggested for selection of the most suitable one for the position intended to be filled. Same principle shall be applied for the posting of heads of attached departments, to be made by the S&GAD as provided in the Balochistan Government Rules of Business, 2012.
viii. in exceptional cases where posting of a junior officer against a senior post or premature transfer is inevitable, prior endorsement from a committee led by the Chief Secretary with ACS (Dev), SMBR, Secretary S&GAD and Law Department as Members shall be mandatory. The committee members shall be personally responsible about the soundness of the proposal. Proper record of the deliberations shall be maintained and produced as and when required.
ix. in case of any failure on the part of state functionary to comply with the said directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Chief Secretary as well as Administrative Secretaries will expose themselves to contempt proceedings under Article 204(2)(a) of the Constitution.
We also record appreciation for the assistance provided by Mr. Muhammad Rauf Atta, learned Advocate General and Mr. Mazhar Ilyas Nagi, amicus curiae during the proceedings.
A copy of this judgment be sent to the Chief Secretary as well as Secretary S&GAD, Government of Balochistan, with direction to streamline the affairs regarding transfer/posting in line with the principles annunciated in Anita Turab's case. They are further directed to circulate the copies of this judgment amongst all the Secretaries, Head of attached departments, Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners and they are further required to comply with this judgment in letter and spirit and report compliance within one month.

JUDGMENT
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.--This judgment shall also decide I.C.As. Nos. 433 and 435 to 439 of 2009 and 226 of 2015, as common questions of law and facts are involved in all these cases.
2. Through this and connected Intra Court Appeals, consolidated judgment dated 06.03.2009, passed by learned Single Judge in Chambers in W.P. No.11148/2003, has been challenged, whereby writ petitions filed by respondents were allowed in the following manner:-
""26. For what has been held above, these petitions are accepted and impugned action of the respondents (UBL and IDBP) whereby the rate of return / profit on Mahana Monafa Certificates and Uni'Sona Certificates, has been reduced unilaterally, is declared to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect. Respondents are held legally bound to pay the depositors the profits, on the agreed terms, as expressly incorporated in the Certificates. The petitioners are entitled to profit at the agreed rate, till final payment in respect of their investments.""
3. Facts of this case, in precise, are that consequent upon promulgation of 'Uni Sona Deposit Scheme' by United Bank Limited, respondents made investment under the terms and conditions of said scheme. However, before maturity of said scheme, appellant-Bank decreased the rate of profit and conveyed it to respondents vide letter dated 09.12.1999, which necessitated the respondents to approach this Court through various writ petitions. The writ petitions have been decided through impugned consolidated judgment dated 06.03.2009, declaring the impugned decrease in the rate of profit to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect. Hence, this and connected appeals.
4. Learned counsel for appellants submit that issue involved in these cases relates to contractual obligations, which cannot be agitated before this Court in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction; that since appellant is a private bank, therefore, writ petitions are not maintainable against it; and that issue to this extent has already been decided by this Court vide judgment dated 08.03.2019 passed in I.C.A. No.37/2015, titled Noor Badshah through L.Rs. v. United Bank Limited through its President and others, following the ratio settled by Hon'ble apex Court in Abdul Wahab and others v. HBL and others (2013 SCMR 1383).
5. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents submit that appellants have agreed, through advertisements, to pay fixed ratio of profit on investments made under said schemes but subsequently same was arbitrarily decreased by appellant bank; that fundamental rights of respondents had been infringed due to unilateral actions of appellant-Bank; and that writ petitions filed by respondents were rightly allowed by learned Single Bench. In support, they relied on order dated 01.12.2008, passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in Civil Petition No.317-L/2005, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and others v. Government of Pakistan and others (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 507), Suo Motu Action regarding non-payment of retirement benefits by the relevant departments and others (2018 SCMR 736) and Pakistan Olympic Association v. Nadeem Aftab Sindhu (2019 SCMR 221).
6. Arguments heard. Record perused.
7. The common grievance agitated by respondents through writ petitions relates to decrease in profit rate on their investments made under 'Uni'Sona Deposit Scheme'. The question of maintainability of writ petition against private bank, for the purpose of exercise of constitutional jurisdiction of this Court, has already been dealt with and decided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Abdul Wahab (supra), wherein it has clearly been laid down that writ petition is not maintainable against a private bank as it does not qualify the status of a person/authority within the meaning of Article 199 of the Constitution. The main reason for said conclusion was that after privatization of bank, it was a private institution having no concern with the affairs of Federation or Province, whereas the State Bank of Pakistan ('SBP') is only a regulatory body for all the banks operating in Pakistan in terms of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and such regulatory role and control of SBP does not bring a bank within the meaning of a person or authority performing functions in connection with affairs of the Federation, which was also followed by Full Bench in the case of Noor Badshah (supra), relevant observations of which are reproduced as under:-
""12. Needless to observe here that constitutional petition is maintainable under Article 199(1)(c) of the Constitution against any person including the body politic or corporate for the purpose of enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by the Constitution but, as observed by the learned Single Bench, claim of the appellants (employees of a private bank) regarding release of grade increments and recalculation of their pensionary benefits etc. is indeed a dispute of private character with the employer bank regarding terms and conditions of service contract, governed under non-statutory rules, and remedy of constitutional petition under Article 199 of the Constitution is pre-eminently a public law remedy and is not generally available against private wrongs. Constitutional jurisdiction of High Court is equipped to serve as a judicial control over administrative actions and where a dispute is of a private character and not for enforcement of fundamental rights as of public duty, constitutional petition is not maintainable for resolution of such private dispute.
13. Undoubtedly, directions under Article 199(1)(c) of the Constitution can be made to any person, which in appropriate circumstances can include a private person, for enforcement of Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II of the Constitution in cases involving (i) Bonded or forced labour; (ii) Wrongful detention; (iii) Restoration of liberty and freedom of movement; (iv) Likelihood of any hazard to life by pollution; but enforcement of any right qua service benefits arising out of non-statutory rules or contract is not amenable to writ jurisdiction as rightly held by the learned Single Bench in the impugned judgment.""
8. Undoubtedly, subject matter of the constitutional petition seeking enforcement of terms of Uni Sona Deposit Scheme has emanated from a contract and the enforcement of the same does not confer legal character. High Court, in ordinary circumstances, cannot embark upon the interpretation of terms of contract and its enforcement. In cases involving disputed facts, such rights cannot be enforced by taking recourse to such jurisdiction. If in every contractual matter, giving rise to enforcement of contractual obligations or a dispute, which can be redressed through remedy available under the law, constitutional petitions are entertained, then the same will defeat the very purpose of law under which competent Courts are established and vested with jurisdiction under the law. This remedy is primarily a public remedy and is not generally available against private wrongs. This jurisdiction is equipped to serve as a judicial control over administrative actions and where a dispute is of a private character and not for enforcement of fundamental rights as of public duty, constitutional petition is not maintainable for resolution of such private dispute. It, being discretionary and extra ordinary, is exercised in grave cases rather than in routine. Despite expansive nature of powers and jurisdiction, it does not enable a High Court to act as an appellate forum. Various trappings or limitations are required to be satisfied before jurisdiction is to be assumed by High Court. Reliance is placed on Noor Muhammad Qureshi and another v. The Divisional Superintendent, Pakistan Railways, Quetta (1979 SCMR 157), Lahore Cantonment Cooperative Housing Society Limited, Lahore, Cantt. through Secretary v. Dr. Nusrat Ullah Chaudhry and others (PLD 2002 SC 1068), Pakcom Limited and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2011 SC 44), Qazi Munir Ahmed v. Rawalpindi Medical College and Allied Hospital through Principal and others [2019 SCMR 648 = 2019 PLC (CS) 928] and Maj. (Retd.) Syed Muhammad Tanveer Abbas and another v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Interior and another (2019 SCMR 984).
9. Needless to say that only exception to it is when State functionary, acting under the statute, has to act in a fair and transparent manner and if disputed questions of fact are not involved. Relief in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction in appropriate matter cannot be denied merely because issues in the matter are relating to contractual obligations. High Court has power to examine the validity of the order in respect to grant a contact and can strike down the same on the basis of mala fide, unfairness and lack of transparency apparent on the record provided that challenge is promptly made and question of fact is not involved, which requires evidence to resolve it and in that case the party can be relegated to seek remedy before Civil Court. Routine contractual disputes between private parties and public functionaries are not bound to scrutiny under constitutional jurisdiction, especially in absence of above elements. Unless Government instrumentality was involved or a clear breach of any statutory provision was committed by the party, contract having no statutory backing, the violation of any provision thereof, if any, will surely not be justiciable under constitutional jurisdiction. The actions, being relating to the contract, are far from having legal infirmities warranting constitutional interference.
10. Learned counsel for respondents contended that learned High Court is empowered to issue directions against any private person in terms of Article 199(1)(c) of the Constitution, hence, writ petitions were rightly allowed. In support, the case law mentioned in their arguments was also referred. Suffice it to say that the Full Bench has already ruled while deciding the case of Noor Badshah (supra) that writ could be issued against a private person for enforcement of fundamental rights granted by the Constitution, in exceptional circumstances mentioned therein, and also held that the judgment delivered by Hon'ble apex Court in the case of Abdul Wahab (supra) has neither been over-ruled nor writ petition was held to be maintainable against private bank by Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the judgments referred by learned counsel for respondents. Further-more, in C.P. No.317-L of 2005, the matter was regarding the scheme issued by Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan, which is a statutory bank and even in that case, question of maintainability of constitutional petition against a private bank was not involved.
Furthermore where the relief is regarding enforcement of contractual stipulations/obligations and infringement of any condition of such a contract at the most entitles the aggrieved person to avail alternate remedy for breach of contract before the Court of plenary jurisdiction. In such a situation, it cannot be argued that fundamental rights of such a person have been violated conferring upon him right to enforce the same in terms of Article 199 of the Constitution. High Court can only interfere where the rights are based on statute, law or rules framed thereunder, or when obligations or duties vest in public functionary or a constitutional body, performing functions in relation to affairs of federation or a province, or a legal authority. In such a situation, even contractual rights and obligations might be enforced in constitutional jurisdiction, which is however, subjected to important rider of corresponding absence of an adequate remedy. Reliance is placed on Zonal Manager U.B.L. and another v. Mst. Perveen Akhtar (PLD 2007 SC 298), Hazara (Hill Tract) Improvement Trust v. Mst. Qaisra Elahi (2005 SCMR 678), Abdul Wahab and Noor Badshah (supra).
11. It is re-emphasized that relief sought by respondents in the present case is primarily with regard to enforcement of contractual obligations between private parties and same cannot be enforced or granted while exercising discretionary jurisdiction of High Court. Appropriate remedy for such matters is through suit before the Court of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore, facts as averred by the respondents were disputed by the appellants. However, respondents are at liberty to avail any other alternate remedy available to them under the law before the relevant forum, including State Bank of Pakistan, if so advised.
12. For what has been discussed above, since writ petitions filed by respondents are not maintainable against appellant-bank, therefore, this appeal, along with connected appeals, are allowed. The impugned judgment passed by learned Single Judge is set-aside and writ petitions stand dismissed.

Date of hearing: 10th December, 2014.
ORDER
ZAFAR AHMED RAJPUT, J.---By invoking the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has prayed for the following reliefs:
a)That, this Honourable Court may be pleased to direct the respondent No.2 extend the contract period to the petitioner for 2-years more as it was extended from time to time in past to the previous contractor enabling the petitioner to meet the investment which petitioner made in the rest house for its maintenance.
b)That, this Honourable Court may be pleased to restrain the respondent No.4 Manager Auqaf Sehwan not to take the possession of the rest house from the petitioner. The respondents further be restrained from auction of the contract in respect of the rest house at Dargah Lal Shahbaz Qalander Sehwan Sharif.
c)Any other relief which this Honourable Court deems fit and proper may be awarded to the petitioner.
2. Briefly stated facts of the case, as narrated in the memo of petition, are that the petitioner, who is a contractor, obtained a contract from the respondents in an open auction for Auqaf Rest House, situated at Dargah Qalandar Lal Shahbaz, Sehwan for a period of one year w.e.f. 28-11-2013 to 27-11-2014 by giving highest bid of Rs.2,86,000/-, which was confirmed by the respondent No.4 vide his letter No.AUQ (CAA)2013/1384 dated 16-12-2013. After completion of the contract period, i.e. one year, the petitioner moved applications to respondents Nos.2 and 4 on 27-09-2014 and 14-11-2014, respectively, for giving him the contract for a further period of three years. It is the case of the petitioner that there is a precedent of extension of the contract, as previously the contract given to one, Nasir Mehmood for the period of three years from 21-11-2003 to 20-11-2006, was extended twice after its expiry for the further period of three years from 21-11-2006 to 20-11-2009 and 21-11-2009 to 20-11-2012, but the respondents Nos. 2 and 4 did not consider his application for extension of contract as they want to give the same to a person of their choice; therefore, the respondent No.2 has got an Auction Notice published in newspapers, vide letter No.05-12-2014, depriving the petitioner from his legal, legitimate and constitutional right.
3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the material available on record.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioner has mainly contended that previously the alleged contract was given for a period of three years but in case of petitioner, it was given for one year only and the same is not being extended by the respondents malafidely. He has also contended that by not following the precedent of extension of the contract, the respondent No.2 have violated the Article 25 of the Constitution that speaks about the equality of the citizens. Lastly he has contended that after obtaining the contract the petitioner has incurred a huge amount for maintenance of subject Rest House and since no adequate efficacious remedy is available, the petitioner has maintained this petition. In support of his contention, the learned counsel has relied upon the following case-law:
i. Hazara (Hill Tract) Improvement Trust, through Chairman and others v. Mst. Qaiser Elahi and others (2005 SCMR 678), wherein the allotment of a plot to predecessor of respondent No.1 was cancelled by the Chairman of Appellant's Trust without any approval of Board of Trustees and providing an opportunity of hearing to her on the ground of non-construction of building within period stipulated in sale deed. Respondents impugned the order of appellant before the Peshawar High Court in petition, which was allowed. Appellants then preferred Civil Appeal, which was dismissed by the apex Court observing the said act of Chairman of Appellant's Trust with mala fide intention as the sale deed of respondent No.1 was intact and she had paid non-utilization fee much prior to the decision of the Board and the same was in violation of principle of natural justice enshrined in the maxim ""Audi Alteram partem"" (no one should be condemned unheard).
ii. 'Messrs Airport Support Services v. The Airport Manager, Quaid-e-Azam International Airport, Karachi and others (1998 SCMR 2268) It has been held that where, in relation to contractual rights having a public element, the manner, the method and the motive of a decision of entering or not entering into a contract by a public functionary is open to judicial review on the touchstone of reasonableness, relevance, fair play natural justice, equity and non-discrimination.
iii. 'Haji Amin v. Pakistan Trading Corporation (Pvt.) Ltd. and another (PLD 2009 Karachi 112) It has been held that normally a writ for the enforcement of a contractual liability is not maintainable. However, State and any functionary acting under the State has to act in fair and transparent manner and, if disputed question of facts are not involved relief in exercise of power under Art. 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 in appropriate matters have not been denied, merely because issues in the matter relates to contractual obligation.
5. The subject Rest House is owned by the Auqaf Department, Government of Sindh. It may be observed that the right in public/State property, which in case in hand was alienated in favour of petitioner through auction for one year, originally belonged to the public/State. The State being a virtual entity exercises its authority through the public functionaries therefore, whenever a right belonging to the public/State is going to be alienated, the public functionary is under obligation to protect and preserve the transparency and to ensure the maximum gain for the public exchequer, essentially extending equal opportunity to all potential competitors, who intend to acquire such property under contract on lease, license etc. There can be no other view to the proposition that the public functionaries, deriving authority from or under law, are obligated to act justly, fairy, equitably, reasonably, without any element of discrimination and squarely within the parameters of law.
6. In the instant case, the alleged contract of the petitioner has already expired on 27-11-2014. It is not the case of the petitioner that his contract had carried any obligatory clause of its extension for any further period. Therefore, prima facie the respondent No.2 by issuing Auction Notice, through publication in newspapers, in respect of subject Rest House for the period of one year has adopted just, fair and a proper procedure/course to ensure transparency and maximum gain. The petitioner is not entitled for any special privilege or preferential treatment, if he intends to take the subject Rest House on contract he should come in competition by participating auction proceedings.
7. So far the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner with regard to the precedent of extension of contract is concerned, we are afraid; we are not convinced. No unjustified and arbitrary action or event that happened at an earlier time can be given perpetuity-two wrongs do not make a right. The case-law cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner is distinguishable, so far the facts of the case in hand is concerned.
8. In view of what has been discussed above, we do not find any merit in this petition, therefore, the same is dismissed in limine, along with listed application.

  JUDGMENT
  MUHAMMAD SHAFI SIDDIQUI, J.--- The petitioner is aggrieved of the unjust act of respondent No.2/TCP whereby it excluded the petitioner from participating in bid and from being considered as successful bidder pursuant to a public tender despite their offer being the lowest and further aggrieved by the mala fide stance of the respondent No.2/TCP that it will continually exclude the petitioner from further tenders, the petitioner filed the present petition.
  2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is a public limited company and respondent No.2 the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP), solely owned and under control of respondent No.1, serves as a public sector trading house. The Board of respondent No.2/TCP comprises of Chairman and four directors, all of whom are nominated and appointed by the Government, and a Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce is included in the Board as ex-officio Director and thus performing functions in connection with the affairs of the government. Respondent No.3 is an autonomous body established under Public Procurement Regularity Authority Ordinance, 2002.
  3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that on 21-5-2012 the respondent No.2/TCP invited applications from sugar mills of Pakistan for purchase of 200,000 metric tons of white sugar vide tender No.DOD/Pur-Sugr/27-1/2012 (hereinafter referred as the ""subject tender""). The interested parties were called upon to submit their bids for a minimum of 5000 and maximum of 10000 metric tons by 7-6-2012.
  4. Pursuant to the aforesaid tenders the petitioner submitted bid form dated 6-6-2012 for a quantity of 10,000 metric tons at a price of Rs.50,500/- per metric ton. Learned counsel submitted that although the petitioner's offer was responsive, however, it was unlawfully disregarded by respondent No.2/TCP on the alleged ground that the petitioner was a defaulter. The bid amount of Rs.10,100,000/-, that had been paid pursuant to a Pay Order No.AAA10335225 drawn on Allied Bank Limited on account of bid money equal to 2% of the total value of the quantity, was however retained by respondent No.2.
  5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner was allegedly considered as defaulter on account of a dispute that has previously arisen between them in respect of a contract dated 1-6-2004 for the purchase of 12,000 metric tons of sugar. The dispute out of this contract was referred to arbitration before an Arbitral Tribunal comprising of Mr. Justice (Retd.) Haider Ali Pirzada and Mr. Muhammad Khalid Farooqui Advocate. The Arbitral Tribunal passed a unanimous Award on 26-4-2007 (hereinafter referred to as the ""said Award"") whereby the amount of Rs.5,936,400/- was allowed to the respondent No.2/TCP (hereinafter called as Award amount). The said Award was placed before this Court under the provisions of Arbitration Act, 1940, to make it Rule of the Court, which was registered as Suit No.547 of 2007 wherein an application was filed by respondent No.2/TCP for modification of the amount.
  6. Learned counsel submitted that till date no modification has been ordered and the amount that is payable under the Award is unchanged. Learned counsel further submitted that out of the Award amount, an amount of Rs.4,625,000/- was unilaterally misapplied by the respondent No.2/TCP towards adjustment thereof despite the bank guarantee dated 17-9-2005, and call for refund by the petitioner in terms of letter dated 14-2-2012 i.e. the amount which was paid by the petitioner as 2% bid money in respect of the Tender No.DOP/Pur-Sugar/19-98/2012 vide Pay Order No.6570606 dated 30-1-2012. Consequently, the alleged remaining dues after the aforesaid adjustment remained as Rs.1,311,400/-. The confirmation of the above adjustment was made by respondent No.2/TCP vide letter dated 5-6-2012 bearing Reference No.TCP/CAD/(L)/355/07. Learned counsel further submits that vide another letter of the same date i.e. 5-6-2012 the respondent No.2/TCP in response to petitioner's letter dated 22-5-2012 addressed that an amount of Rs.5,936,400/- had been allowed to the respondent No.2/TCP under the aforesaid Award and since the petitioner has not preferred any appeal, it was established that the petitioner was defaulter of respondent No.2/TCP and could not be allowed to participate in future tenders. Accordingly, in response to the said letter a Pay Order bearing No.6571959 dated 6-6-2012 for Rs.1,311,400/- drawn on Habib Bank Limited under cover of a letter was submitted. Thus, per learned counsel the outstanding amount in respect of the Award was promptly tendered.
  7. Pursuant to this payment the petitioner addressed respondent No.2/TCP on 6-6-2012 to allow it to participate in the subject tender in view of the fact that the entire payment of the Award amount has been made/adjusted. The said letter was replied on 7-6-2012 (tender opening date) whereby respondent No.2/TCP refused the petitioner to participate in the tender process on the ground that the petitioner was a defaulter. More importantly it was stated that they have applied for modification of the amount and thus the petitioner was not allowed to participate in the tender and the pay order of Rs.1,311,400/- was returned whereas at the time of filing of the petition the amount of Rs.10,100,000/-, that had been paid on account of bid money equal to 2% of the total value of the offered quantity, was not returned.
  8. Upon opening of the tender, per learned counsel, the petitioner's offer appeared to be lowest of all although petitioner was not allowed to participate and as such the standard operating procedure of respondent No.2/TCP was violated which deals with the awarding of the contract to the lowest bidder. Learned counsel contended that since the petitioner's right to participate in the bid was denied as such there is no other efficacious remedy provided under the law and this petition is filed since the departmental appeal would not serve as an efficacious remedy in the circumstances of the case.
  9. Thus, learned counsel submitted that the categorization of the petitioner as a defaulter by the respondent No.2/TCP is perverse, arbitrary, unjustified and violative of principle of natural justice and fundamental rights and the petitioner through this petition seeks declaration that the categorization of the petitioner as defaulter pursuant to the action taken by the respondent No.2/TCP is unjustified and violative of principle of natural justice and fundamental rights and that the petitioner's offer has to be considered and accepted by the respondent No.2/TCP as being the lowest bid in relation to the subject tender and that the respondent No.2/TCP be restrained from awarding any contract or taking any step in perpetuation or furtherance of the subject tender without considering and accepting the petitioner's offer. Learned counsel in support of his contentions relied upon (i) 2010 CLC 1810, (ii) 2006 CLD 674, (iii) 2010 CLC 1046, (iv) 1999 MLD 1238, (v) PLD 1997 Karachi 627, (vi) PLD 1967 SC 530, (vii) 2009 MLD 1399, (viii) PLD 1996 SC 109, (ix) PLD 1998 Karachi 79, (x) 2001 CLC 713, (ix) 2010 CLD 1829, (xii) 1998 CLC 221, (xiii) 2010 CLD 1838 and (xiv) 2001 MLD 1876. On preliminary issue of maintainability learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon 1999 SCMR 1072, PLD 1996 Karachi 68, 1990 MLD 126, 1990 CLC 1044, PLD 2003 SC 322, 2007 MLD 770, PLD 1992 Karachi 258, PLD 1992 Karachi 283.
  10. In response to this learned counsel for respondent No.2/TCP submitted that the petition is not maintainable under the law as they have not availed the remedy as provided under Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 and the rules framed thereunder. Learned counsel further submitted that the petitioner has been lawfully excluded from participating in the subject tender since by virtue of arbitration Award dated 26-4-2007 the petitioner has been declared as defaulter. Learned counsel further submitted that earlier a tender was awarded vide contract dated 1-6-2004 for the purchase of 12000 metric tons and the petitioner in utter breach of terms and conditions of the tender submitted forged Cane Commissioner's Certificate and subsequently unilaterally cancelled the contract causing loss to the tune of millions of rupees to the respondent No.2/TCP.
  11. Learned counsel further submitted that owing to their past conduct the petitioner was not allowed to participate in the subject tender and were rightly excluded as per policy and terms and conditions of the subject tender. Learned counsel further submitted that keeping in consideration said public interest the respondent No.2/TCP has invoked a policy of excluding those sugar mills who defaulted with respondent No.2/TCP from participating in the tender unless they clear their dues before tender opening date in a bona fide manner. Such contention was also incorporated in para 4 of the counter-affidavit to the memo of petition. Learned counsel submits that the tenders are awarded by the respondent No.2/TCP strictly in terms of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 and the rules framed thereunder which were promulgated to regulate the procurement process by public authorities in the larger national interest and that the petitioner's exclusion was made pursuant to the Ordinance ibid and is in consonance with rules thereunder. Learned counsel further submitted that they have already preferred an application for the modification of the amount before this Court in Suit No.547 of 2007 and an amount of Rs.196,624,577/- is in fact the actual claim of the respondent No.2/TCP against the petitioner though it is sub judice.
  12. Learned counsel further submitted that the respondent No.2/TCP with an aim to address all the problems of sugarcane growers and sugar industry decided a summary dated 18-5-2004 that 15% payment of the contract amount in respect of Tender No.E&M/Sugar/Pur-0/04 (earlier awarded to the petitioner) will be made subject to confirmation by the respective Provincial Cane Commissioner that the dues of sugarcane growers are cleared before 15-6-2004. Respondent No.2/TCP floated tender notice dated 21-5-2004 wherein the respondent No.1's said condition of Cane Commissioner's Certificate was incorporated and the petitioner fraudulently obtained a clearance certificate of 100% payment to the grower from the Cane Commissioner. As against this fraudulent submission of certificate the petitioner received 15% payment of the contract amount illegally in the year 2004 and that the Cane Commissioner on 21-8-2004 has issued a show-cause notice to the petitioner on account of the fact that such clearance certificate was obtained fraudulently and that the issue of show-cause notice was pending adjudication. The petitioner, however, on 31-12-2004 unilaterally cancelled the contract dated 1-6-2004 on the ground that the respondent No.2/TCP has failed to pay remaining 10% payment payable on start of crushing season which caused loss of millions of rupees to respondent No.2/TCP.
  13. In support of his contentions learned counsel has relied upon (i) SBLR 2011 Sindh 1249, (ii) 2011 PLC 258, (iii) 2011 PTD 647, (iv) 2011 MLD 1484, (v) 2011 MLD 1876 and (vi) 1989 SCMR 1892.
  14. Learned standing counsel appearing for the Federation of Pakistan has adopted the arguments advanced by learned counsel for respondent No.2/TCP.
    15. We have heard the learned counsel and perused the record. The prime question that needs to be resolved first is regarding the maintainability of the petition as the propriety demands that such questions are to be decided first. Since learned counsel for respondent No.2/TCP has raised a crucial point that under Public Procurement Regularity Authority Ordinance, 2002 and rules framed thereunder an appeal is to be preferred. The subject Rule 48 is reproduced hereunder:---
  ""48. Redressal of grievance by the procuring agency.--- (1) The procuring agency shall constitute a committee comprising of odd number of persons, with proper powers and authorizations, to address the complaints of bidders that may occur prior to the entry into force of the procurement contract.
  (2) Any bidder feeling aggrieved by any act of the procuring agency after the submission of his bid may lodge a written complaint concerning his grievances not later than fifteen days after the announcement of the bid evaluation report under rule 35.
  (3) The committee shall investigate and decide upon the complaint within fifteen days of the receipt of the complaint.
  (4) Mere fact of lodging of a complaint shall not warrant suspension of the procurement process.
  (5) Any bidder not satisfied with the decision of the committee of the procuring agency may lodge on appeal in the relevant court of jurisdiction.""
  16. Since the counsel have relied upon certain case-laws in support of their respective contentions it is beneficial to reproduce, the relevant portion of such judgments:---
  Petitioner's citations
  (i) 1999 SCMR 1072 (Gatron (Industries) Ltd. v. Government of Pakistan).
  In this judgment the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:---
  ""---Rule that invoking the constitutional jurisdiction was possible only after exhausting all other remedies, is a Rule of convenience and discretion by which the Court regulates its proceedings---Said Rule is not a Rule of law affecting the jurisdiction.""
  (ii) PLD 1996 Karachi 68 (Kamran Industries v. Collector of Customs (Exports))
  The learned Division Bench in the aforesaid judgment observed as under:---
  ""---Alternate remedy, when non-availing of, no bar---Where the impugned action is completely without jurisdiction and patently illegal it is not essential to avail the alternate remedy.
  ----Alternate remedy---Question involving interpretation of fiscal rights----Rule pertaining to alternate remedy is not applicable in matters pertaining to interpretation of fiscal rights and instruments.""
  (iii) 1990 MLD 126 (Gul Ahmed Textile Mills Ltd. v. Collector of Customs (Appraisement))
  ""----Availability of an adequate alternative remedy no doubt bars the constitutional remedy under Article 199 of the Constitution and absence of such remedy is a pre requisite for the invocation of constitutional jurisdiction. A satisfaction however is to be reached by the Court that such projected adequate remedy is, in reality an adequate one, in the absence of being equally inexpensive, expeditious, beneficial and efficacious. If that be not so, such cannot be an adequate remedy. The Rule on this very hypothesis, is that where a serious question of interpretation of law is involved it is futile to continue to seek such interpretation at the departmental level and that in order to save time and avoid duplication of procedural bottle-necks constitutional jurisdiction may, directly, be resorted to. In the ultimate analysis, as to what the law is has always to be determined by the superior Courts. In relation to such a question departmental remedies can never be adequate within the meanings of the constitutional mandate. On similar reasoning is based the now too well-established rule that sub-constitutional Tribunals can never Judges of their own jurisdiction.---""
  (iv) PLD 1963 SC 322 (Nagina Silk Mills v. Income Tax Officer)
  ""Notwithstanding section 67, Income Tax Act, 1922, which bars civil suit to set aside or modify an assessment made under the Act, the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of the High Court can be invoked in challenging an income tax assessment on the basis that the officer concerned lacked jurisdiction to pass the impugned order. The writ jurisdiction was conferred on the High Court by a constitutional provision and even if there be a conflict between such a provision and another statute, the Constitutional provision must prevail.
  ... Even where a particular statute takes away certiorari (and that result can only be achieved by express negative words) the English Courts have decided that certiorari may be granted where the inferior Tribunal has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction for in such a case the tribunal has not brought itself within the terms of the statute taken away certiorari.""
    (v) 2007 MLD 770 (Hydri Ship Breaking Industries v. Sindh Government and others)
  ""...Alternate remedy---whether the alternate remedy available to petitioner, who are seeking constitutional remedy was adequate or not, depended on the special or particular circumstances of the individual case and it was precisely for that reason that in one case High Court could not entertain petition under its constitutional jurisdiction and in another case same could be entertained---in taking a decision whether alternate remedy in a given case was adequate or not, to enable the High Court to take the further decision relating to entertaining the constitutional petition, the Court, in the background of the particular facts of the case before it, would consider several factors---questions of speed and expenses of the alternate remedy could be considered---whether the alternate remedy was as effective or efficacious as the constitutional remedy, was also a relevant factor---whether in the circumstances of the case alternate remedy or the constitutional petition would be the appropriate remedy, could also be a pertinent consideration.
  (vi) PLD 1992 Karachi 258 (Messrs S. Abdulla & Co. v. Collectors of Customs (Appraisement)
  ""... Constitutional Petition---competency---alternate remedies of appeal/revision not resorted to by the petitioner---Effect---constitutional petition would be competent for, question involved in petition was applicability or otherwise of notification on which respondent had already taken decision that same was applicable---Resort to appeal or revision, would, thus, have been a futile effort.""
  (vii) PLD 1992 Karachi 283 (Messrs Pacific Multinational (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Inspector-General of Police)
  ""....Petitioner contended that award of contract for purchase of helicopters to respondent by government, not only amounted to denial of legitimate right of petitioner to obtain such contact, but it also showed arbitrary and unfair exercise of discretion by government in selecting contracting party, resulting in loss to public exchequer---petitioner's allegations did make out a case for consideration by court in exercise of its power under Art. 199 of the Constitution---constitutional petition was, thus, maintainable in circumstances.""
  17. On the other hand learned Counsel for respondent No.2/TCP has relied upon the following cases:---
  (i) 2011 PLC 258 (Mehmood-ul-Hassan v. Government of Sindh)
  ""...alternate remedy was available to petitioners under relevant provisions of Payment of Wages Act, 1936---All pleas which were taken by the petitioners before High Court could be taken before appropriate forum---When there was alternate remedy available to petitioners, constitutional petition was not maintainable and petitioners might avail the alternate remedy available to them under the law---Petition was dismissed in circumstances.""
  (ii) 2011 PTD 647 (BP Pakistan Exploration and Production Inc. v. Additional Commissioner Karachi)
  ""....Where there is alternate remedy available, constitutional jurisdiction under Art.199 of the Constitution cannot be invoked---While exercising constitutional jurisdiction, High Court must be satisfied about non-availability of any other adequate remedy provided by law to petitioners---Authority vested in High Court under Art.199 of the Constitution is not meant to render alternate remedy redundant.""
  (iii) 2011 MLD 1484 (Muhammad Akbar Shah v. Federation of Pakistan and others)
  ""If all the litigants are permitted to take all sorts of their disputes to the High Court without first availing other remedies available to them under the law, it will not only unnecessarily increase the workload of the High Courts but would also defeat the provisions of law by which the said remedies have been made available. Such a spree on the part of the litigants would amount to abuse of the constitutional jurisdiction, which is to be exercised by the High Courts in exceptional cases to provide justice, which cannot be otherwise obtained by the aggrieved parties.
  (iv) 2011 MLD 1876 (Messrs KSB Pumps Company Ltd. v. Government of Sindh)
  ""Though there is no absolute bar in entertaining grievances of an aggrieved persons in exercise of writ jurisdiction, however, such discretion is to be exercised with circumspection and as an exception and not as a rule. In cases, where there is jurisdictional error, lack of authority and the alternate remedy is not efficacious, depending on facts and circumstances of each case, extraordinary jurisdiction can be invoked.""
  (v) 1989 SCMR 1892 (Pakistan Barmah Shell Ltd. v. Mrs. Nasreen Irshad and others)
  In this case it has been held that legislative intent must be given effect to and respected.
  18. As far as the judgments cited by the learned Counsel for the respondents are concerned, the judgment cited at Serial No.(i) is in respect of Payment of Wages Act, 1936 and all issues arising out therefrom were liable to be lawfully adjudicated whereas the petitioner's case was allegedly covered by Rule 48 ibid which deals with cases from a particular stage i.e. post bid stage. Thus, the application of such Rule is open only after an event i.e. entertainment of the bid which is missing in the case in hand. As observed earlier the basic right to participate has been denied. Same is the case with case-law at Serial No.(ii) where efficacious remedy was available. The judgments mentioned at Serial Nos.(iii) and (iv) contains the answer itself as they suggest that there is no absolute bar and that the discretion is to be exercised with circumspection and it should not be applied as a rule. It further elaborates that if there is a jurisdictional error, lack of authority and that the alternate remedy is not efficacious, extraordinary jurisdiction can be invoked. Further the judgment at Sr. No.(iv) pertains to Sindh Public Procurement Act, 2009 and 2010 which is quite different and distinct from the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 and Public Procurement Rules, 2004. The last case at Serial No.(v) pertains to a matter in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the legislative intent must be given effect to and respected while in the case in hand it is certainly not the intent to oust the petitioner from competitive business. It is not the intent that the petitioner should be condemned unheard. It is not the intent of legislature that their basic right to do business should be violated as prescribed in Article 18 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan and it is not the intent that petitioner should be discriminated. The intent of the Ordinance, 2002 and rules thereunder is that after allowing a person to participate, the complaints or grievances on merits are to be considered by committee but here before that stage could come the petitioner is ousted from participating in the tender/competitive business hence is discriminated.
  19. If the action of the public functionary in awarding a contract lacks transparency, writ would lie as it has been their constitutional obligation to act fairly and justly while performing the administrative functions and if any unfair or arbitrary actions are complained of or discrimination is being agitated, such grievances can be dealt with in exercise of its power of judicial review under Article 199 of the Constitution if the Court otherwise is satisfied that the action complained of is arbitrary and unfair and the same can be struck down. Somewhat similar view was also taken by a Division Bench in case of Reliance Consultancy v. Federation of Pakistan reported in 2010 CLC 1046 wherein the Division Bench observed that, ""had it been a case where the bid of the petitioner had been rejected for being not responsive and the bid of someone else had been accepted, it would have been appropriate to enter into a question whether the bid of the bidder being treated as not responsive was justified in the circumstances or not"".
  20. Similarly, in the case of Arif Builders and Developers v. Government of Pakistan (PLD 1997 Karachi 627) a similar view was taken by Mr. Justice (Retd.) Kamal Mansoor Alam, as he then was wherein it has been held as under:---
  ""There seems no doubt that the Government does not have unfettered powers to deal with its properties or to award contracts, licenses or other benefits, and unlike private individuals, it cannot arbitrarily pick and choose persons for bestowing favours. Its action should be based on a reasonable and rational procedure which is non discriminatory and aimed at, on the one hand, to provide equal opportunity to eligible persons and on the other to avoid loss to the exchequer. The discretion vested in the State functionaries must be exercised judicially and not arbitrarily and should be based on sound principle of justice and fairness.""
  The observation of the learned Single Judge is of course persuasive and we uphold such observation.
  21. The above discussion is made on the basis of ""Administration of justice"", however, we now deal with the rule 48 separately hereunder.
  22. Sub-Rule (1) of Rule 48 of the Public Procurement Rules, 2004 deals with the constitution of a committee comprising of odd number of persons who would deal with the complaints of bidders that may occur prior to the entry into the force of procurement contract. Hence the word ""filing of bid"" is not used purposely.
  23. This rule has no application to the case in hand since the stage discussed in sub-rule (1) has not reached for the petitioner as they were refused to participate in the subject tender on account of being defaulter and hence the occurrence of such complaint prior to the entry into force of the procurement contract does not arise. This rule prima facie reflects that it deals with the complaints of those bidders who's bids have been entertained without any objection and hindrance which is not the case here when we deal with the petitioner's case. The stage prior to the entry into force of the procurement contract would come only when petitioner would have been allowed to participate.
  24. Similarly sub-Rule (2) of Rule 48 discussed the stage of submission and entertainment of bid by procuring agency whereafter the aggrieved bidder could lodge complaint which stage has not reached for the petitioner. The petitioner had been refused and left out of the contest for all time to come by letter dated 7-6-2012 issued by General Manager (Legal) who too does not enjoy such authority and power. The basic question of entitlement to participate in the bid was refused which situation is not met or dealt with in this sub rule hence not applicable. Same is the case with sub-Rules 3, 4 and 5.
  25. The above sub-rules clearly demonstrate that the complaints under this rule would be with regard to the issue after entering of petitioner in the contest of the bid and the issues arising thereafter would then be open for complaints under this rule accordingly. Thus basic right to participate in the bid was taken away by the letter issued by the General Manager (Law) Legal Division which is neither a procurement agency nor a committee constituted under the aforesaid rule.
  26. The ratio of the above, judgments cited, clearly demonstrate that there is no absolute bar. The jurisdiction of the superior Courts cannot be ousted/taken away by these subordinate legislations. The constitutional petition challenges the illegality committed by the respondent No.2 whereby the petitioner for all time to come has been ousted to participate in the tenders which is their main business concern. The petitioner in this petition seeks a declaration that the categorization of the petitioner as a defaulter and the action taken by the respondent No.2 on that basis is perverse, arbitrary and unjustified and hence they have been deprived to participate in the tenders for all time to come. This situation is not dealt with by the Rule 48 ibid. In this case the procurement agency itself formulated a Committee under Rule 48 of Public Procurement Rules, 2004 as such prima facie it does not provide efficacious and alternate remedy. We accordingly hold that under the circumstances this writ petition is maintainable.
  27. Since we have decided the issue of the maintainability in favour of the petitioner we would now revert back to the arguments raised by counsel for the parties on merits of the case.
  28. The prime questions which were addressed by learned counsel for the petitioner are that they were excluded from participating in tender on three propositions;---
  (1) That petitioner is a defaulter.
  (ii) That the claim of the respondent No.2/TCP is far above than what had been decided by the Arbitral Tribunal and
  (iii) That the history of the petitioner is such that it was excluded from participating in the subject bid.
  29. In order to resolve the controversy we would first highlight the crucial letter issued by respondent No.2/TCP dated 21-5-2012. In the opening para the respondent No.2/TCP has categorically highlighted the issue of alleged defaulters as under:---
  "".....However, the sugar mills who defaulted with the TCP are not eligible to participate in the tender unless they clear their dues before tender opening date. Detailed specifications /requirements are indicated in Tender Document containing tender terms and conditions.""
  30. Similarly under the terms and conditions of the subject tender dated 21-5-2012 it has been highlighted as condition No.14(f) as under:---
  ""The sugar mills who have defaulted with TCP in terms of any previous/past contracts shall not be allowed to participate in this tender unless they clear all the dues before the tender opening date.""
  31. The award that has been placed as Annexure D/1 deals with the issue of past history regarding which parties opted for Arbitration to resolve their dispute by appointing one Arbitrator each and which resulted in passing of a unanimous award. At page 15 of the award, the Arbitral Tribunal also declares that, ""none of the parties had committed breach of contract"".
  32. On 22-5-2012 the petitioner addressed respondent No.2/TCP that pursuant to tender for purchase of 200,000 metric tons dated 22-5-2012 the petitioner has a right to participate and further requested for assurance that they are allowed to do so.
  33. In terms of letter dated 5-6-2012, the respondent No.2/TCP addressed the petitioner that since the petitioner had not preferred any objection against the Award dated 26-4-2007, therefore, in view of the admitted/unappealed Arbitral Award an amount of Rs.4.625 Million dated 23-1-2012 has been encashed by TCP towards partial payment/ adjustment of their claim.
  34. Subsequently, on 5-6-2012 the respondent No.2/TCP has again addressed the petitioner that since it has been established that the petitioner (Messrs Adam Sugar Mills Ltd.) are TCP's defaulter and in consideration of TCP's policy to safeguard its interest from defaulting parties in the future it has been decided that Messrs Adam Sugar Mills Ltd. being a defaulter cannot be allowed to participate in future tenders for the purchase of sugar or otherwise. This letter is attached as annexure F-2 to the petition. By this letter which is issued by the General Manager, Legal Division, for the first time the right to participate was unconditionally denied to the petitioner as previously this right was denied conditionally i.e. subject to clearance of dues before tender opening date. It is pertinent to point out that the tender opening date was 7-6-2012 and this letter was issued 48 hours before the opening of the tender. Be that as it may, on 6-6-2012 the petitioner sent an additional Pay Order No.6571959 dated 6-6-2012 of the balance amount of Rs.1,311,400/- to satisfy/ discharge the outstanding amount in terms of the Award. In addition to the above another letter of the same date was addressed by the petitioner to the Chairman Trading Corporation of Pakistan with following contentions:---
  ""That we have sent to you the balance amount Rs.1,311,400/- which clears the whole award amount as such we do not come in the category of defaulter hence your letter under reply is uncalled for and now we are fully entitled to participate in the current tender dated 7-6-2012.
  Under the circumstances you are requested to allow us to participate in the present tender for purchase of 2 lacs M.T. sugar otherwise we will take appropriate legal action in this regard.""
  35. On the opening date of the tender i.e. 7-6-2012 the respondent No.2/TCP returned the said pay order/demand draft dated 6-6-2012 amounting to Rs.1,311,400/- in respect of the balance arbitral award amount with the observation that since the petitioner is a defaulter of TCP and in order to safeguard its interest it has already been decided that mill (petitioner) being defaulter cannot be allowed to participate in the tender unless all claim of Respondent No.2 are settled in a bona fide manner. In this letter again they wrote conditional participation of petitioner and on the other hand returned the pay order of the balance amount outstanding against the petitioner in terms of unanimous award. We are unable to understand that at one hand respondent No.2 is asking for settlement of outstanding amount and on the other hand returning the pay order of the balance outstanding amount in terms of Award.
  36. We have observed that in the correspondence as well as in the counter-affidavit and the reply to the memo of petition, it is a consistent approach of the respondent No.2/TCP that unless the dues were cleared before the tender opening date, the defaulted parties are not allowed to participate in the bidding process of the said tender. Such stance was highlighted in para 4 of the counter-affidavit to the memo of petition, which is as under:---
  ""That the contents of para 4 of the petition are a matter of record. It is submitted that participation in the subject tender was conditional and those ""sugar mills who defaulted with the TCP are/were not eligible to participate in the tender unless they clear their dues before tender opening date"". The petitioner having defaulted with the Respondent No.2 was rightly excluded from participating in the subject tender pursuant to the said condition.""
  37. To declare petitioner as a defaulter a very heavy burden is upon the respondent No.2/TCP which they have not discharged. The petitioner cannot be adjudged as a defaulter by respondent No.2 either before or after the litigation. Even in case reported as 2006 PCr.LJ 263 passed by learned Single Judge of Lahore High Court, the F.I.R. No.126/2005 against the petitioner regarding previous case which was agitated by respondent No.2 as (history) was quashed. The original claim of TCP was rightly disputed and eventually it comes out to be Rs.5,936,400/- as against their claim of Rs.196,624,577/- and the unanimous award that was passed by the Arbitral Tribunal on 26-4-2007 was placed before the Sindh High Court.
  38. In one of the judgment cited i.e. Messrs Huffaz Seamless Pipe Industries v. Allied Bank of Pakistan Limited (2001 CLC 713) it has been observed as under:---
  ""It is pertinent to note that the amount being claimed by the defendant has not been finally determined or adjudicated by a competent Banking Court. Apprehension of the plaintiff that the mark-up have been wrongly and maliciously calculated and that huge penalties have been imposed cannot be ruled out at this stage. What amount the plaintiff is liable to pay is yet to be determined by a competent Banking Court. It is to be noted that the Banking Courts are reluctant in granting liquidated damages in favour of Banks. Learned counsel for the defendant was not able to satisfy this Court as to the definition of the term ""wilful default.""
  .... It is desired that the defendant-Bank before forwarding the name of the plaintiff as defaulter to the State Bank of Pakistan will consider all the above noted facts.""
  39. Thus, the ratio of the above judgment tends to support the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner cannot be adjudged as defaulter by respondent No.2/TCP. In view of above submissions and judgments cited we are inclined to observe that under the facts and circumstances of the case the petitioner on payment of outstanding dues in terms of the Award on 6-6-2012 cannot be termed as a defaulter and hence cannot be ousted to participate in the subject tender process. The act of ousting the petitioner to participate in the tender lack authority and jurisdiction and violative of Articles 18 and 25 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan and hence such acts and decisions are amenable to writ jurisdiction and the petitioner has rightly challenged arbitrary and unjustified decision through this constitutional petition.
  40. Apart from these observations and stand taken by respondent No.2/TCP the prime document which set out the terms and conditions is the purchase order dated 21-5-2012 and the terms and conditions of the subject tender of the same date, particularly term 14(f) and the opening paragraph of the purchase order. Since this is their own term and condition that before participating they should clear their outstanding dues and since we have observed above that the outstanding amount on the basis of which they could be ousted and considered as a defaulter has been paid and for a balance portion the petitioner attempted to pay before the opening date of the tender, which was returned by respondent No.2, in our opinion the petitioner could hardly be considered as a defaulter of TCP to participate in the subject tender. We, hardly see any substance in the arguments of the learned counsel for respondent No.2/TCP that since their claim is much more than the amount decided by the Arbitral Tribunal, the petitioner ought to have deposited entire claim. Until and unless the Award amount is modified or changed the prima facie amount is the one mentioned in the Award.
  41. We are of the view that the terms and conditions on the basis of which the subject tender was issued do not cover such history and it is not under the terms and conditions of tender that the mill owners were asked to pay all outstanding amount, thus the defence of respondent No.2/TCP regarding history, also fails. More particularly, the default, if any, pertains to the grower which is also as per their own submission is sub judice. Needless to mention that in terms of the purchase order dated 21-5-2012 and the terms and conditions set out of the same date, it is the stand of the respondent No.2/TCP that all those sugar mills who defaulted with the TCP are not eligible to participate, hence the alleged outstanding as far as the growers are concerned is beyond the ambit of the terms and conditions of the subject tender. It is quite surprising that since 2004 they have been pursuing the aforesaid issue in respect of tender of 12000 metric tons, however, they have not made any attempt to determine the status of the petitioner until 7-6-2012. The alleged historical issue pertains to 2004 and till date the respondent No.2/TCP has not blacklisted the petitioner, if at all law permits.
  42. We may observe that the Trading Corporation of Pakistan being a public functionary/procuring agency was obliged to procure such service by means of open competitive biddings in fair and transparent manner and the discretion that these public authorities may enjoy, cannot be exercised in an arbitrary and capricious manner. It has been established that the open competitive bidding is invariably the best method for ensuring the transparent and unobjectionable process.
  43. In view of the above observations and legal points raised we categorically hold that this writ petition is maintainable, the petitioner has been wrongly ousted from participating in the subject tender and their categorization as a permanent defaulter is not sustainable under the law. We accordingly, allow this petition as the petitioner is found entitled to participate in the bid and is also found entitled for required quota of 10,000 Metric Tons for which petitioner has submitted its bid. We may however clarify that the rest of the quota of 190,000 metric tons shall not be disturbed in terms of this judgment and the principle of last in first out should be followed. The pending applications also stand disposed of.

    JUDGMENT
  ASAD MUNIR, J.---The facts of the case, being not in dispute, are that on 18-1-2002 a Petroleum Concession Agreement (""PCA"") for exploration in the Safed Koh Block, District Dera Ghazi Khan, was entered into between the President of Pakistan and a Joint Venture, operated by the petitioner-company. Fortunately, the Joint Venture was successful in making a commercial discovery of gas in March, 2005 at Salsabil (Rodho) located in the concession area of the Safed Koh Block. Thereafter, upon Government of Pakistan's approval of the Commercial Discovery and Development Plan, a Development and Commercial Lease was executed on 23-1-2006 in favour of the Joint Venture operated by the petitioner-company.
  2. In accordance with Article 10.2(d) and (e) of the PCA, the Government of Pakistan vide its letter dated 19-6-2006 nominated Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (""SNGPL"") as the purchaser of gas from the petitioner company. However, as soon as the petitioner-company commenced its sale of gas to SNGPL in 2006, a dispute arose about the well-head price of gas because of the difference over the interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of the PCA which sets out the formula for fixation of the gas price. There being no resolution of the dispute as to the fixation of gas price by reference to Article 10.2(f), since 2006 gas is being sold to SNGPL at a provisional well-head price advised from time to time by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (""the Ministry"") and notified by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (""OGRA"") under section 6(2)(w) of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, Ordinance, 2002.
  3. In order to settle the dispute as to the fixation of the gas price by reference to Article 10.2(f), it appears that the matter was discussed between the parties including the Prime Minister who with the mutual consent of the petitioner-company and the Ministry decided to refer the issue for the opinion of the Attorney General. Thereafter, vide letter dated 21-11-2006, the Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources through the Ministry of Law and Justice referred the dispute for the advice of the Attorney General. Pursuant to the reference, the Attorney General vide letter dated 13-11-2007, gave his opinion the operative apart whereof is reproduced below:--
  ""4. According to Messrs Dewan Petroleum (Pvt.) Limited, the price is to be computed in the manner that first market price in respect of various zones is to be determined then the discounts to the marker price are to be applied to the marker price in the manner provided in the agreement itself. On the other hand, the view of the Government is that first the discounts are to be applied and then the marker price is to be determined.
  5. In my opinion, the viewpoint of the Dewan Petroleum is supported by the Agreement, therefore, the stand taken by the Dewan Petroleum has more merits than the stand of the Government. The agreement itself provides that first the marker price is to be determined and then the discounts are to be applied to the marker price. If the stand taken by the Government is accepted then the word ""first"" in the relevant clause becomes redundant.
  6. Accordingly, I am of the view that on correct interpretation of Article 10.2(f) first marker price is to be determined and then the discounts applied.""
  4. It is the stance of the petitioner-company that the dispute over the interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of PCA stood resolved by the afore-said opinion of the Attorney-General but respondent No.1, has refused to accept the binding opinion of the Attorney-General for Pakistan and consequently has not fixed the price of gas in the light of the said opinion. It is contended by Messrs Waseem Sajjad, Sami Zafar and Malik Qamar Afzal, learned counsel for the petitioner-company that the petitioner-company agreed with the respondents to refer the matter to the Attorney-General before whom there were many hearings attended by each side supporting its respective interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of the PCA. The said reference was by way of an amicable settlement as visualized in Article 28 of the PCA prior to invoking the arbitration clause. They also argued that the opinion of the Attorney-General, having been made under Rule 14(2) of the Rules of Business, 1973, is binding on the Ministry for having not been over-ruled in accordance with Rule 14(3) ibid. Learned counsel have also contended that the opinion of the Attorney-General holds the field for having not been challenged before any forum by the Ministry who is otherwise bound by it on account of promissory estoppel as the reference to the Attorney-General was proposed by the respondents and agreed to by the petitioner-company at considerable risk.
  5. On the other hand, a number of preliminary objections have been raised by Mr. Yousaf Khosa, the learned counsel for respondents Nos. 1 and 2, who has submitted that a host of remedies are available to the petitioner-company wherefor this writ petition is not maintainable. In this regard, he has referred to Article 28 of the PCA, which provides that any question or dispute arising out of or in connection with the PCA must be referred to arbitration after the parties fail to reach an amicable settlement. Secondly, it is contended that the remedy of a suit for specific performance is also available to the petitioner-company to redress its grievance of the gas price not being fixed in accordance with Article 10.2(f) of the PCA. Thirdly, reference has also been made to section 12 of the OGRA Ordinance, 2002, to contend that the petitioner company can challenge the gas price notification issued by OGRA for being not in accordance with the PCA. Exercise of constitutional jurisdiction by this Court has also been objected to on the ground that petitioner-company is not an aggrieved person as its grievance stems out of an agreement in the absence of any plea of violation of any law and that the writ of mandamus, being sought, cannot the issued under Article 199 of the Constitution as there is no lapse on the part of the public functionary to do anything he is required by law to do.
  6. Mr. Yousaf Khosa has also painstakingly argued against the interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of the PCA espoused by the petitioner-company and supported by the Attorney-General. According to him, the issue is complex and there are at least 4 if not more interpretations of Art.10.2(f) of the PCA in circulation, each one of them having its own logic and appears to be a correct interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of the PCA and resultantly, the complex issue of gas price can be resolved by means of bilateral negotiations only. Mr. Khosa has also discarded opinion dated 11-7-2007, rendered by the Attorney-General, for not being given by a petroleum industry expert and for being incomplete, in-exhaustive, in-determinative and for failing to address the issues referred to him. It is further pleaded that the Attorney-General's opinion is not binding as it is neither an award nor an amicable settlement nor is the Government bound by it under the Rules of Business, 1973, nor is there any law or rule as would suggest that the Attorney-General's opinion is binding on the Government.
  7. Article 10.2(f) of the PCA, being the cause of discord between the parties, is reproduced below: --
  ""Whenever a Working Interest owner is selling pipeline quality Natural Gas of Acceptable specification to nominated buyers, it shall subject to Article 10.3, receive a price per Million British Thermal Unit (MMBTU). The price to be paid to a Working Interest Owner shall be determined for a six (6) monthly period (hereinafter referred to as 'the Price Notification Period') starting at eight (8) a.m. P.S.T. on 1st January and 1st July each year except the first period which may commence from the start of Commercial production till 30th June or 31st of December as the case may be.
  The price of acceptable pipeline quality Natural Gas to be notified per MMBTU shall be computed as follows:
  (i) First determine the ""Marker Price"" which shall be 67.5% for Zone III, 72.5% for Zone II and 77.5% for Zone 1 of the weighted average C & F price per barrel (based on quoted FOB prices) of the basket of Crude Oils imported into Pakistan during the first six Months period of the seven Months period immediately preceding the relevant Price Notification Period.
  Apply following discounts to Marker Price.
  Floor and ceiling will be US$ 10/barrel and US$ 36/barrel of C & F price, respectively with following discounts:
  Over US$ 10/barrel and upto US$16/barrel: 100% of Marker Price
  Over US$ 16/barrel and upto US$21/barrel: n Plus 50% of incremental Marker Price.
  Over 21 /barrel and upto US$26/barrel: plus 30% of incremental Marker Price; and
  Over and above US$26/barrel upto the ceiling: plus 20% of incremental Marker Price.""
  (ii) ""Using the appropriate conversion factor, convert the discounted Marker Price to MMBTU rounding the quotient to four (4) decimal places to arrive at price per MMBTU""
  8. As is evident from the foregoing narration, the legal effect on the opinion of the Attorney-General needs to be determined in order to answer the question as to whether in the circumstances of the present case such opinion is binding upon the parties particularly the Federal Government, who says it is not.
  9. Before dealing with the status of his opinion, it will not be out of place to state that the Attorney-General for Pakistan is the Chief Law Officer and Chief Legal Advisor of the Federal Government who is appointed by the President under Article 100 of the Constitution ""to give advice to the Federal Government upon such legal matters, and to perform such other duties of a legal character as may be referred or assigned to him by the Federal Government, and in the performance of his duties he shall have the right of audience in all Courts and Tribunals in Pakistan."" Being not a member of the Senate or the National Assembly, the Attorney-General is non-political yet has an exalted status as he has the right, under Article 57 of the Constitution, to address and advise either House on a constitutional and legal issue that may arise in the course of a debate. Besides, whenever there is a challenge to the constitutionality to any legislative enactment, Order XXVII-A, rule 1, Civil Procedure Code, mandates that a notice must be issued to the Attorney-General to appear and represent the Federal Government.
  10. Although giving of advice to the Federal Government is a duty the Attorney-General has to perform under the Constitution, there is no express provision in the Constitution or any enactment which provides that such advice is to be followed by the Government or is binding on the Government. There is also no precedent on the point at least in our jurisdiction probably because there have been no instances where the Government has publicly disowned or discarded the advice or opinion of its Attorney-General. It would, thus, be safe to assume that consistent with his status as the Chief Legal Advisor of the Federal Government, the advice or opinion of the Attorney-General merits to be honoured by the Federal Government.
  11. It would also be pertinent to refer to the Rules of Business, 1973, framed by the President under Article 99 of the Constitution, to see if any primacy is attached to the advice or opinion of the Attorney-General. Rule 14(2) envisages that the Attorney-General shall be consulted but only through the Law and Justice Division, previously called Human Rights Division. Rule 14(3) provides as under:--
  ""If there is disagreement between the views of the Attorney-General and Human Rights Division, the case shall be submitted to the Minister for Human Rights for opinion. If the Minister disagrees with the Attorney-General, the case shall be referred to the Prime Minister for orders who may refer the matter to the Cabinet if he so desires"".
  12. It is evident from Rule 14(3) that primacy is attached to the advice or opinion of the Attorney-General as even the Law Minister cannot over-rule it but only disagree with it in which event the matter is to be referred to the Prime Minister who has the discretion to take a decision himself or refer the matter to the Cabinet. Accordingly, it follows that the opinion of the Attorney-General is to prevail unless it is over-ruled by the Prime Minister or the Cabinet. In the instant case, there is nothing on record to suggest any disagreement of the Law Minister or that the Prime Minister had over-ruled the opinion of the Attorney-General with the result that the opinion had acquired primacy within the Federal Government.
  13. Apart from the primacy that the Attorney-General's opinion had acquired under Rule 14(3) of the Rules of Business, 1973, it is admitted on record that the dispute over the gas price was referred for the opinion or advice of the Attorney-General by the Prime Minister with a promise or representation made or understanding given to the petitioner company that the opinion of the Attorney-General would be binding on both the parties. This undisputed fact is borne out by letter dated 29-3-2007, written by M. Zaheer Alam, director (Gas), Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources, which is reproduced below:-
  ""Subject:- GAS SALE AND PURCHASE AGREEMENT (GSA) WITH SNGPL.
  Reference President's Secretariat (Public) Aiwan-e-Sadr, Islamabad U.O.No.6 (181) / Directed (B-1)06 dated 27-9-2006 on the above subject.
  2. The case, which involves interpretation of Petroleum Policy, 2001 and the Petroleum Concession Agreement, has been referred to the Attorney-General of Pakistan as advised by the Prime Minister, for seeking his opinion which will be binding on both the parties. The opinion of the Attorney-General is still awaited. President's Secretariat (Public) will be apprised of the decision taken in this case as soon as the advice received.
  14. The afore-said promise, representation or understanding only shows that the mode or means proposed by the Prime Minister was mutually agreed upon by the parties to settle their outstanding dispute. The mode or means agreed was the opinion of the Attorney-General which having been declared to be binding when rendered amounted to a settlement of the dispute. In the face of this position, respondents Nos. 1 and 2 cannot discard the opinion of the Attorney-General by saying that he was not qualified to give the opinion as he was not a petroleum industry expert or that his opinion is otherwise deficient. Having been given pursuant to the mutual agreement that it would be binding on the parties, the opinion must qualify to be regarded as an amicable settlement visualized under Article 28.1 of the PCA, which also does not prescribe any particular mode or form of settlement leaving it open to the parties to adopt any means as would achieve the objective of amicable settlement.
  15. Given the undisputed facts of the case, it has to be said that the Attorney-General's opinion is also binding on the Federal Government on account of promissory estoppel, a principle which has been consistently recognized and enforced by the Superior Courts in Pakistan wherever a person has acted on the faith of a promise or representation made by the Government who is not allowed to resile from it. In the present case, admittedly a promise or representation was made by the Federal Government that the Attorney-General's opinion would be binding and it is in pursuance of the promise that the petitioner-company submitted itself and its case to the Attorney-General who after many hearings gave his opinion. In other words, the petitioner-company was induced by the promise to take part in the proceedings before the Attorney-General and by doing so, the petitioner-company took a risk and also gave up the other options it could seek for the resolution of the dispute. After having made the promise which has also been acted upon, the Federal Government also has no locus poenitentiae to resile from its promise and take the position that the opinion of the Attorney-General is not binding.
  16. Mr. Khosa has also urged that Article 10.2(f) of the PCA is complex and is capable of at least four (4) different and equally logical interpretations and that in view thereof it is only through negotiated settlement by the parties that the fixation of gas price can be achieved. Such an ambiguous stance is of no help and only emphasizes that the opinion of the Attorney-General was called for to find the correct interpretation of Article 10.2(1) of the PCA.
  17. As regards the objection to the maintainability of the writ petition, it has been contended by Mr. Khosa that the remedy of reference of dispute to arbitration is available under Article 28 of PCA. The argument of the learned counsel seems to be misconceived considering that the opinion of the Attorney-General, being the correct interpretation of Article 10.2(1) of the PCA, is a settlement of the dispute under Article 28.1 ibid. As such, after the settlement of the dispute, no dispute exists that can be referred to arbitration. The grievance, which is subject-matter of this writ petition, does not relate to the dispute over the interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of PCA but arises out of failure of the Federal Government to abide by the opinion of the Attorney-General. The remedy of suit for specific performance of contract suggested by the learned counsel is also based on a misconception that the dispute is over the interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of PCA and is not about the status of the Attorney-General's opinion. The remedy under section 12 of the OGRA Ordinance, 2002, is also of no avail to the petitioner-company as OGRA in its parawise comments has stated that it has not fixed the gas price but has only notified it on the advice of the Ministry and has also expressed its inability to rule on the binding effect of the Attorney-General's opinion. In view thereof, the afore-said objections to the maintainability of the writ petition are not tenable.
  18. There is yet another objection to the maintainability of the writ petition as it has been contended that the petitioner-company cannot being a constitutional petition in respect of a contractual matter. This contention also cannot be sustained as it disregards the nature of the grievance raised in this writ petition. Though linked to the interpretation of the contract, the grievance arises out of failure of the Ministry to follow the opinion of the Attorney-General. It is not about a contract involving the determination of disputed questions of fact but pertains to the status of the opinion of the Attorney-General. In any case, it is settled law that constitutional jurisdiction can be exercised even in contractual matters provided no controversial questions of fact requiring detailed inquiry are involved. In this regard, it would be relevant to refer to Messrs Airport Support Services v. The Airport Manager Quaid-e-Azam International Airport Karachi and others (1998 SCMR 2268) wherein it was held as under:--
  ""It has consistently been held that while routine contractual disputes between private parties and public functionaries are not open to scrutiny under the Constitutional jurisdiction, breaches of such contracts, which do not entail inquiry into or examination of minute or controversial questions of fact, if committed by Government, semi-Government or Local Authorities or like controversies if involving dereliction of obligations, flowing from a statute, rules or instructions can adequately be addressed for relief under that jurisdiction.""
  I may also refer to Hazara (Hill Tract) Improvement Trust through Chairman and others v. Mst. Qaisra Elahi and others (2005 SCMR 678) wherein the plea that no writ petition was maintainable for enforcement of contractual obligations was rejected by the honourable Supreme Court.
  19. In the light of the afore-said discussion, I am of the view that the Attorney-General's opinion dated 13-11-2007 as to the interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of the PCA is binding on the Federal Government and amounts to a settlement contemplated under Article 28.1 of the PCA. As a consequence, the writ petition is allowed and the respondents Nos. 1 and 2 are directed to fix the well-head price of gas at Salsabil (Rodho) at the earliest in the light of and in accordance with the opinion dated 13-11-2007 rendered by the Attorney-General. Parties are left to bear their own costs.

    JUDGMENT
  ASAD MUNIR, J.---The facts of the case, being not in dispute, are that on 18-1-2002 a Petroleum Concession Agreement (""PCA"") for exploration in the Safed Koh Block, District Dera Ghazi Khan, was entered into between the President of Pakistan and a Joint Venture, operated by the petitioner-company. Fortunately, the Joint Venture was successful in making a commercial discovery of gas in March, 2005 at Salsabil (Rodho) located in the concession area of the Safed Koh Block. Thereafter, upon Government of Pakistan's approval of the Commercial Discovery and Development plan, a Development and Commercial Lease was executed on 23-1-2006 in favour of the Joint Venture operated by the petitioner-company.
  2. In accordance with Article 10.2(d) and (e) of the PCA, the Government of Pakistan, vide its letter dated 19-6-2006 nominated Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (""SNGPL"") as the purchaser of gas from the petitioner company. However, as soon as the petitioner-company commenced its sale of gas to SNGPL in 2006, a dispute arose about the well-head price of gas because of the difference over the interpretation of Article 10.2(0 of the PCA which sets out the formula for fixation of the gas price. There being no resolution of the dispute as to the fixation of gas price by reference to Article 10.2(0, since 2006 gas is being sold to SNGPL at a provisional well-head price advised from time to time by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (""the Ministry"") and notified by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (""OGRA) under section 6(2)(w) of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, Ordinance, 2002.
  3. In order to settle the dispute as to the fixation of the gas price by reference to Article 10.2(0, it appears that the matter was discussed between the parties including the Prime Minister who with the mutual consent of the petitioner company and the Ministry decided to refer the issue for the opinion of the Attorney General. Thereafter, vide letter dated 21-11-2006, the Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources through the Ministry of Law and Justice referred the dispute for the advice of the Attorney General. Pursuant to the reference, the Attorney General vide letter dated 13-11-2007, gave his opinion the operative part whereof is reproduced below:--
  ""4. According to M/S Dewan Petroleum (Pvt.) Limited, the price is to be computed in the manner that first market price in respect of various zones is to be determined then the discounts to the market price are to be applied to the market price in the manner provided in the agreement itself. On the other hand, the view of the Government is that first the discounts are to be applied and then the market price is to be determined.
  5. In my opinion, the viewpoint of the Dewan, Petroleum is supported by the Agreement, therefore, the stand taken by the Dewan Petroleum has more merits than the stand of the Government. The agreement itself provides that first the market price is to be determined and then the discounts are to be applied to the market price. If the stand taken by the Government is accepted then the word ""first"" in the relevant clause becomes redundant.
  6. Accordingly, I am of the view that on correct interpretation of Article 10.2(0 first market price is to be determined and then the discounts applied.""
  4. It is the stance of the petitioner-company that the dispute over the interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of PCA stood resolved by the aforesaid opinion of the Attorney General but respondent No.1, has refused to accept the binding opinion of the Attorney General for Pakistan and consequently has not fixed the price of gas in the light of the said opinion. It is contended by M/s. Waseem Sajjad, Sami Zafar and Malik Qamar Afzal, learned counsel for the petitioner-company that the petitioner-company agreed with the respondents to refer the matter to the Attorney General before whom there were many hearings attended by each side supporting its respective interpretation of Article 10.2(0 of the PCA. The said reference was by way of an amicable settlement as visualized in Article 28 of the PCA prior to invoking the arbitration clause. They also argued that the opinion of the Attorney General, having been made under Rule 14(2) of the Rules of Business, 1973, is binding on the Ministry for having not been over-ruled in accordance with rule 14(3) ibid. Learned counsel have also contended that the opinion of the Attorney General holds the field for having not been challenged before any forum by the Ministry who is otherwise bound by it on account of promissory estoppel as the reference to the Attorney General was proposed by the respondents and agreed to by the petitioner-company at considerable risk.
  5. On the other hand, a number of preliminary objections have been raised by Mr. Yousaf Khosa, the learned counsel for respondents Nos.1 and 2, who has submitted that a host of remedies are available to the petitioner company wherefor this writ petition is not maintainable. In this regard, he has referred to Article 28 of the PCA, which. Provides that any question or dispute arising out of or in connection with the PCA must be referred to arbitration after the parties fail to reach an amicable settlement. Secondly, it is contended that the remedy of a suit for specific performance is also available to the petitioner company to redress its grievance of the Gas price not being fixed in accordance with Article 10.2(t) of the PCA. Thirdly, reference has also been made to section 12 of the OGRA Ordinance, 2002, to contend that the petitioner company can challenge the Gas price notification issued by OGRA for being not in accordance with the PCA. Exercise of constitutional jurisdiction by this Court has also been objected to on the ground that petitioner-company is not an aggrieved person as its grievance stems out of an agreement in the absence of any plea of violation of any law and that the writ of mandamus, being sought, cannot the issued under Article 199 of the Constitution as there is no lapse on the part of the public functionary to do anything he is required by law to do.
  6. Mr. Yousaf Khosa has also painstakingly argued against the interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of the PCA espoused by the petitioner company and supported by the Attorney General. According to him, the issue is complex and there are at least 4 if not more interpretations of Article 10.2(t) of the PCA in circulation,, each one of them having its own logic and appears to be a correct interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of the PCA and resultantly, the complex issue of gas price can be resolved by means of bilateral negotiations only. Mr.Khosa has also discarded opinion dated 11-7-2007, rendered by the Attorney General, for not being given by a petroleum industry expert and for being incomplete, in-exhaustive, in-determinative and for failing to address the issues referred to him. It is further pleaded that the Attorney General's opinion is not binding as it is neither an award nor an amicable settlement nor is the Government bound by it under the Rules of Business, 1973 nor is there any law or rule as would suggest that the Attorney General's opinion is binding on the Government.
  7. Article 10.2(f) of the PCA, being the cause of discord between the parties, is reproduced below:
  'Whenever a Working Interest owner is selling pipeline quality Natural Gas of Acceptable specification to nominated buyers, it shall subject to Article 10.3, receive a price per Million British Thermal Unit (MMBTU). The price to be paid to a Working Interest Owner shall be determined for a six (6) monthly period (hereinafter referred to as `the Price Notification Period') starting at eight (8) a.m. P.S.T. on Ist January and Ist July each year except the first period which may commence from the start of Commercial production till 30th June or 31st of December as the case may be.
  The price of acceptable pipeline quality Natural Gas to be notified per MMBTU shall be computed as follows:
  (i) First determine the ""Market Price"" which shall be 67.5% for Zone III, 715% F.I.R. Zone II and 77.5% for Zone I of the weighted average C&F price per barrel (based on quoted FOB prices) of the basket of Crude Oils imported into Pakistan during the first six Months period of the seven Months period immediately preceding the relevant Price Notification Period.
  Apply following discounts to Market Price.
  Floor and ceiling will be US$ 10/barrel and US$ 36/barrel of C&F price, respectively with following discounts:
  Over US$ 10/barrel and up to US$ 16/barrel; 100% of Market Price.
  Over US$ 16/barrel and up to US$21/barrel; plus 50% of incremental Market Price.
Over 21/barrel and up to US$26/barrel plus 30% of incremental Market Price; and
  Over and above US$26/barrel up to the ceiling; plus 20% of the incremental Market Price.
  (ii) ""Using the appropriate conversion factor, convert the discounted Market Price to MMBTU rounding the quotient to four (4) decimal places to arrive at Price per MMBTU"".
  8. As is evident from the foregoing narration, the legal effect on the opinion of the Attorney General needs to be determined in order to answer the question as to whether in the circumstances of the present case such opinion is binding upon the parties particularly the Federal Government, who says it is not.
  9. Before dealing with the status of his opinion, it will not be out of place to State that the Attorney General for Pakistan is the chief law officer and chief legal advisor of the Federal Government who is appointed by the President under Article 100 of the Constitution ""to give advice to the Federal Government upon such legal matters, and to perform such other duties of a legal character as may be referred or assigned to him by the Federal Government, and in the performance of his duties he shall have the right of audience in all Courts and Tribunals in Pakistan."" Being not a member of the Senate or the National Assembly, the Attorney General is non-political yet has an exalted status as he has the right, under Article 57 of the Constitution, to address and advise either House on a constitutional and legal issue that may arise in the course of a debate. Besides, whenever there is a challenge to the constitutionality to any legislative enactment, Order XXVII-A, Rule 1, Civil Procedure Code, mandates that a notice must be issued to the Attorney General to appear and represent the Federal Government.
  10. Although giving of advice to the Federal Government is a duty the Attorney General has to perform under the Constitution, there is no express provision in the Constitution or any enactment which provides that such advice is to be followed by the Government or is binding on the Government. There is also no precedent on the point at least in our jurisdiction probably because there have been no instances where the Government has publicly disowned or discarded the advice or opinion of its Attorney General. It would, thus, be safe to assume that consistent with his status as the chief legal advisor of the Federal Government, the advice or opinion of the Attorney General merits to be honoured by the Federal Government.
  11. It would also be pertinent to refer to the Rules of Business, 1973, framed by the President under Article 99 of the Constitution, to see if any primacy is attached to the advice or opinion of the Attorney General. Rule 14(2) envisages that the Attorney General shall be consulted but only through the Law and Justice Division, previously called Human Rights Division. Rule 14(3) provides as under:-
  ""If there is disagreement between the views of the Attorney General and Human Rights Division, the case shall be submitted to the Minister for Human Rights for opinion. If the Minister disagrees with the Attorney General, the case shall be referred to the Prime Minister for orders who may, refer the matter to the Cabinet if he so desires.""
  12. It is evident from Rule 14(3) that primacy is attached to the advice or opinion of the Attorney General as even the Law Minister cannot over-rule it but only disagree with it in which event the matter is to be referred to the Prime Minister who has the discretion to take a decision himself to refer the matter to the Cabinet. Accordingly, it follows that the opinion of the Attorney General is to prevail unless it is overruled by the Prime.Minister or the Cabinet. In the instant case, there is nothing on record to suggest any disagreement of the Law Minister or that the Prime Minister had over-ruled the opinion of the Attorney General with the result that the opinion had acquired primacy within the Federal Government.
  13. Apart from the primacy that the Attorney General's opinion had acquired under Rule 14(3) of the Rules of Business, 1973, it is admitted on record that the dispute over the Gas price was referred for the opinion or advice of the Attorney General by the Prime Minister with a promise or representation made or understanding given to the petitioner company that the opinion of the Attorney General would be binding on both the parties. This undisputed fact is borne out by letter dated 29-3-2007, written by M. Zaheer Alam, Director (Gas), Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources, which is reproduced below:
  ""Subject: Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement(GSA)with SNGPL.
  Reference President's Secretariat (Public) Aiwan-e-Sadr, Islamabad u.o.No.6(181)/Directed (B-1)06 dated 27-9-2006 on the above subject.
  2. The case, which involves interpretation of Petroleum Policy, 2001 and the Petroleum Concession Agreement, has been referred to the Attorney General of Pakistan as advised by the Prime Minister, for seeking his opinion which will be binding on both the parties. The opinion of the Attorney General is still awaited. President's Secretariat (Public) will be apprised of the decision taken in this case as soon as the advice received.
  14. The aforesaid promise, representation or understanding only shows that the mode or means proposed by the Prime Minister was mutually agreed upon by the parties to settle their outstanding dispute. The mode or means agreed was the opinion of the Attorney General which having been declared to be binding when rendered amounted to a settlement of the dispute. In the face of this position, respondents Nos.1 and 2 cannot discard the opinion of the Attorney General by saying that he was not qualified to give the opinion as he was not a petroleum industry expert or that his opinion is otherwise deficient. Having been given pursuant to the mutual agreement that it would be binding on the parties, the opinion must qualify to be regarded as an amicable settlement visualized under Article 28.1 of the PCA, which also does not prescribe any particular mode or form of settlement leaving it open to the parties to adopt any means as would achieve the objective of amicable settlement.
  15. Given the undisputed facts of the case, it has to be said that the Attorney General's opinion is also binding on the Federal Government on account of promissory estoppel, a principle which has been consistently recognized and enforced by the Superior Courts in Pakistan wherever a person has acted on the faith of a promise or representation made by the Government who is not allowed to resile from it. In the present case, admittedly a promise or representation was made by the Federal Government that the Attorney General's opinion would be binding and it is in pursuance of the promise that the petitioner-company submitted itself and its case to the Attorney General who after many hearings gave his opinion. In other words, the petitioner-company was induced by the promise to take part in the proceedings before the Attorney General and by doing so, the petitioner-company took a risk and also gave up the other options it could seek for the resolution of the dispute. After having made the promise which has also been acted upon, the Federal Government also has no locus poenitentiae to resile from its promise and take the position that the opinion of the Attorney of the Attorney General is not binding.
  16. Mr. Khosa has also argued that Article 10.2(f) of the PCA is complex and is capable of at least four (4) different and equally logical interpretations and that in view thereof it is only through negotiated settlement by the parties that the fixation of gas price can be achieved. Such an ambiguous stance is of no help and only emphasizes that the opinion of the Attorney General was called for to find the correct interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of the PCA.
  17. As regards the objection to the maintainability of the writ petition, it has been contended by Mr. Khosa that the remedy of reference of dispute to arbitration is available under Article 28 of PCA. The argument of the learned counsel seems to be misconceived considering that the opinion of the Attorney General, being the correct interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of the PCA, is a settlement of the dispute under Article 28.1 ibid. As such, after the settlement of the dispute, no dispute exists that can be referred to arbitration. The grievance, which is subject-matter of this writ petition, does not relate to the dispute over the interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of PCA but arises out of failure of the Federal Government to abide by the opinion of the Attorney General. The remedy of suit for specific performance of contract suggested by the learned counsel is also based on a misconception that the dispute is over the interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of PCA and is not about the status of the Attorney General's opinion. The remedy under section 12 of the OGRA Ordinance, 2002, is also of no avail to the petitioner-company as OGRA in its parawise comments has stated that it has not fixed the gas price but has only notified it on the advice of the Ministry and has also expressed its inability to rule on the binding effect of the Attorney General's opinion. In view thereof, the aforesaid objections to the maintainability of the writ petition are not tenable.
  18. There is yet another objection to the maintainability of the writ petition as it has been contended that the petitioner-company cannot bring a constitutional petition in respect of a contractual matter. This contention also cannot be sustained as it disregards the nature of the grievance raised in this writ petition. Though linked to the interpretation' of the contract, the grievance arises out of failure of the Ministry to follow the opinion of the Attorney General. It is not about a contract involving the determination of disputed questions of fact but pertains to the status of the opinion of the Attorney General. In any case, it is settled law that constitutional jurisdiction can be exercised even in contractual matters provided no controversial questions of fact requiring detailed inquiry are involved. In this regard, it would be relevant to refer to M/s. Airport Support Services v. The Airport Manager Quaid-e-Azam International Airport Karachi and others (1998 SCMR 2268) wherein it was held as under:--
  ""It has consistently been held that while routine contractual disputes between private parties and public functionaries are not open to scrutiny under the Constitutional jurisdiction, breaches of such contracts, which do not entail inquiry into or examination of minute or controversial questions of fact, if committed by Government, semi-Government or Local Authorities or like controversies if involving dereliction of obligations, flowing from a statute, rules or instructions can adequately be addressed for relief under that jurisdiction.""
  I may also refer to Hazara (Hill Tract) Improvement Trust through Chairman and others v. Mst. Qaisra Elahi and others (2005 SCMR 678) wherein the plea that no writ petition was maintainable for enforcement of contractual obligations was rejected by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
  19. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the view that the Attorney General's opinion dated 13-11-2007 as to the interpretation of Article 10.2(f) of the PCA is binding on the Federal Government and amounts to a settlement contemplated under Article 28.1 of the PCA. As a consequence, the writ petition is allowed and the respondents Nos. 1 and 2 are directed to fix the well-head price of gas at Salsabil (Rodho) at the earliest in the light of and in accordance with the opinion dated 13-11-2007 rendered by the Attorney General. Parties are left to bear their own costs.

    JUDGMENT
  SHAHID ANWAR BAJWA, J.-- Vide short order announced on 6-4-2010, this Constitutional petition was dismissed for reasons to be recorded later. The following are the reasons for the short order announced in Court on 6-4-2010.
  2. Facts as pleaded in the petition are that petitioner is a Private Limited Company and is carrying on business of construction and supply of goods to various organizations and departments including respondent No.2, Pakistan Steel Mills Corporation. Pakistan Steel invited tenders for infrastructure/development work of Gulshan-e-Hadeed. Petitioner submitted his bid and it is stated in the petition that his bid was the lowest amongst the bids submitted. It is further submitted that besides petitioner seven other pre-qualified contractors also submitted their bids. Despite the fact that the petitioner was the lowest bidder, Pakistan Steel Mills was reluctant to award contract to the petitioner, Consequently the petition was filed with the following prayers:--
  (1) Declare that the act of the respondents for not awarding the contract work to the lowest bidder i.e. petitioner is illegal, unlawful, against principles of natural justice, fairness and equity.
  (2) To direct the respondents to immediately award contract to the petitioner.
  (3) To restrain the respondents, their attorneys, agents or any person / body acting on their behalf from awarding the contract to any other contractor till the disposal of this petition.
  3. Comments were filed by Pakistan Steel and it was stated in the comments that since none of the bidding firms were found to be completely responsive to the tender documents it was decided that the tenders be scrapped and fresh tenders be called from existing pre-qualified firms/contractors. Consequently it was pleaded by Pakistan Steel that petition has become infructuous and is therefore liable to be dismissed.
  4. Learned counsel for the petitioner referred to various documents and submitted that since the petitioner was the lowest bidder he has a vested right that his bid be accepted. He submitted that Pakistan Steel is an organization being owned and controlled by the Federal Government. Therefore, while exercising its discretion it must not resort to arbitrariness. He has further submitted that his right to conduct business is guaranteed to him under Article 18 of the Constitution and if he does not conduct his business or his such right to conduct business is hampered it amounts to denial of right to life which is guaranteed to him under Article 9 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. He further submitted that although Pakistan Steel has pleaded that the tender was not responsive but no material has been placed on record to substantiate by Pakistan Steel and therefore the reasons given by Pakistan Steel and therefore the reasons are patently false and flimsy. Learned counsel relied upon Ayaz Builders through Partner v. Karachi Water and Sewerage Board through Managing Director and 2 others, 2007 CLC 728 and Federal Government Employees Housing Foundation through Director General, Islamabad and another v. Muhammad Akram Alizai, Deputy Controller, PBC, Islamabad PLD 2002 SC 1079.
  5. Mr. M.G. Dastagir, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the bids submitted by the petitioner as well as other pre-qualified persons were found deficient and non-responsive because the words and rates have not been quoted in figures which was violation of Clause IT 19-1(c) of the Tender Documents. He further submitted that some pages of bill of quantity of the petitioner had been found changed and tender bank guarantee submitted by the petitioner was not as per requirement of the tender documents as laid down in Clause IT-29-1 of Tender Documents. He further submitted that a party who submits bid does not acquire any vested right merely for the fact that the bid submitted by it is the lowest. He further submitted that non-acceptance of the bid does not cause any legal injury to a party because it has not acquired a right by mere fact that its bid is the lowest. Learned counsel relied 'upon Messrs Bagh Construction Company v. Federation of Pakistan and others 2001 YLR 2791, City Schools (Pvt.) Ltd., Lahore Cantt. v. Privatization Commission, Government of Pakistan and another 2002 CLD 1158, Mst. Noor Jehan Begum v. Dr. Abdus Samad and others 1987 SCMR 1577 and Fateh Muhammad Agha and another v. City District Government, Karachi through District Coordination Officer and 5 others 2009 CLD 1336.
  6. We have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel and have also gone through the record as well as case-law cited at the bar.
  7. In Ayaz Builders case (supra) which was decided by a Division Bench of this Court, facts were that Karachi Water and Sewerage Board invited bids for construction of certain civil works and three concerns responded. When the bids were opened it was found that the bid of the petitioner was the lowest. Officer of KWSB started negotiations with the other bidders. Therefore writ petition was filed with the prayer, inter alia, that the petitioner being the lowest bidder is entitled to be awarded the contract for the project in question. The High Court observed as under:-
  ""8. It would be seen that per settled law, mere participation in a bidding process does not entitle a bidder to claim the contract in question, although it may be the lowest. However, an unsuccessful bidder can certainly approach this Court where it alleges mala fides and discrimination etc., in the award of the contract to another bidder. In this regard reference can be made to Owaisco v. Federation of Pakistan, Messrs Pacific Multinational (Pvt.) Ltd., v. I.-G. of Police Sindh and Asadullah Mangi v. P.I.A. (supra). Similarly, it would be seen that per settled law executive authorities have been enjoined to act fairly, bona fidely and in a manner which ensures transparency of the process before them. In this regard reference can be made to Dadahbhoy Investment (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1995 Kar.33. Asadullah Mangi v. P.I.A. and Abid Hussain v. P.I.A. (supra).""
  Consequently, High Court allowed the petition and ordered KWSB to again invite public tenders for the project in question and thereafter conduct a transparent, fair and judicious exercise in evaluating the tenders.
  8. In Muhammad Akram Alizai's case (supra), the appellant, Federal Government Employees Housing Foundation, with a view to establish a housing scheme acquired land through Land Acquisition Collector, Islamabad and allotted plots to its members. Respondent being an employee of the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation applied for a plot which application was rejected on the ground that he was not employee of Federal Government. Supreme Court held that the Constitutional petition was maintainable. It further held that if entitlement of a person to allotment of plot in the scheme of Housing Foundation or a right of allotment if already created is undone, on any ground .he aggrieved person can maintain a writ petition in the High Court.
  9. In Bagh Construction Company's case (supra), facts were that the Privatization Commission invited public bids for sale of its several properties including the property located at Garden Road Karachi. The petitioner deposited earnest money and participated in the open bid. Petitioner was subsequently informed that his bid being highest was accepted. Petitioner pleading that the letter of acceptance had created some confusion sought clarification calling upon the Privatization Commission to provide photocopies of title documents of the property in question. Later on it transpired that one of the properties was property of another company and that was subject-matter of litigation in a civil suit. The petitioner suggested that finalization of sale of such property be deferred till the title is established a civil suit. Matter continued at that and bid of the petitioner was cancelled and the two properties were re-advertised and therefore writ petition was filed. It was held by the High Court that the Government/Executive did not enjoy or possess any inherent authority and further that powers or duties were inseparably annexed to it laying down that Government/Executive act must be backed by contemporaneous law. The High Court further held that no contract had been created between the parties in that case.
  10. In City School's case (supra), Privatization Commission advertised for sale of ""Federal Lodge, Chamba House, Lahore"". Said school participated in open bidding and its bid was the highest. However, it was not accepted by the Privatization Board because according to it the bid was not satisfactory and therefore it was ordered that the bidding be held again. Petitioner approached the Board and offered to re-negotiate but to no effect. Writ petition was filed and it was disposed of by the High Court with a direction to the Privatization Commission to summon the petitioner, to provide it details of the decision and reasons and thereafter to hear the petitioner and to decide the matter keeping in view the principles of fairness and justice as also the larger public interest. C. P. L. A. was filed in the Supreme Court. Operation of the order of the High Court was stayed and Privatization Commission was permitted to re-auction the said property. Subsequently Askari Commercial Bank informed the petitioner that Privatization Commission had encashed the demand draft furnished by it. The Supreme Court held as under:
  ""(11) Perusal of different provisions of the Contract Act reveals that a tender notice is merely an invitation for making an offer and not by itself an offer or proposal. The advertisement does not constitute a proposal. Only by acceptance of offer or proposal by the person calling for tender it becomes a promise or agreement. When offer of tenderer is not accepted by the relevant authority, no legal right accrues to such tenderer. An agreement enforceable by law becomes a contract. The true test for deciding whether a valid contract is made between the parties or not is to ascertain if the parties were of one mind on all the material terms at the time it is said to have been finalized and whether they intended that the matter was closed and concluded between them. For this purpose, the correspondence exchanged between the parties is also to be looked into.""
  11. In Noor Jehan Begum's case (supra), it was laid down as under: --
  ""A mere possibility that a person could obtain a property by making the highest bid if an evacuee property is disposed of by public auction does not give any such potential bidder a vested right in the property. The right of a person to bid in an auction '_ a right shared by him with every other citizen and the mere fact that the property, which is liable to be disposed of through auction is not so disposed of and the potential bidder deprived the opportunity of offering the highest bid at such an auction does not make him an ""aggrieved person"" so as to give him a right to maintain a Constitutional petition.""
  12. In Fateh Muhammad Agha's case (supra), facts were that petitioner was successful bidder in an open auction and consequently he paid the entire consideration in the manner stated in the letter of acceptance. Subsequently he received a letter cancelling auction. The High Court noticed that auction was held and the petitioner was successful bidder and in accordance with the terms and conditions of publication, successful bidder whose bid was accepted by competent authority was required to pay balance 50% of the consideration and that petitioner was informed through acceptance letter regarding acceptance of his bid and he was told that he was to pay balance amount within 30 days. It was also stated that in case of non-payment of the amount within stipulated period, sale of the plot shall be cancelled and the 25% deposit will be forfeited. The amount demanded was admittedly paid within due date. On behalf of City District Government it was contended that it had right to cancel and revoke the bid without assigning any reason at any time. High Court observed as under:--
  ""We are afraid such brazen discretion cannot be left to be exercised by the public functionary like CDGK. We have no cavil to the proposition that authority may reserve to itself a right to accept or reject bid/offer without assigning any reason, provided such authority is exercised with circumspection, due care and utmost responsibility. Such reservation of authority to reject the bid does not clothe the public functionary with brazen and arbitrary power to reject the offer merely because it possesses such power and or that it reserved to itself such power. Such right or reserve action to cancel or revoke the bid could only be retained till the offer is not accepted by the competent authority as reserved under the invitation to offer. Once that stage is crossed and the competent authority approves the bid/offer a binding contract comes into being. Signing of the formal agreement etc. is but procedural requirements. It may be observed that CDGK performed its functions and discharge its duties and exercise the power and authority under the SLGO, 2002. Unlike private individuals, CDGK being public functionary has to exercise its authority with all care and diligence. Once offer is invited on stated terms and conditions adherence to representation and commitment is obligated upon such functionary. Onerous responsibility is cast upon public functionary to establish and regain its credibility and public trust and confidence in discharge of its public duties and functions which is fact eroding. There is serious dearth of credibility in the public functionaries. All possible efforts should be made by the public functionary to live up to the commitment and live up to the expectation of the common citizen in the realm of contractual obligation committed by it in discharge of its statutory duties.""
  13. In the present case, the facts that must not be lost sight of are:
  (1) Bids were invited.
  (2) Petitioner was the lowest bidder and no letter of acceptance has been issued.
  (3) Tender has been scrapped and fresh tenders have not yet been invited.
  (4) It is contended by Pakistan Steel that the bids submitted by the petitioners as well as other bidders were not responsive and it is, on the contrary, contended by the petitioner that bids were responsive in every material aspect.
  14. It is in this context of facts that the case-law should be evaluated.
  15. In Fateh Muhammad Agha's case (supra), bid has been accepted and balance consideration had been paid. The observations of the Court are clear that once the payment has been received a contract is created and therefore, it would not be available to the City District Government to revoke the same. In the present case bid had not yet been accepted. Therefore, the facts of the case are quite distinguishable. In Ayaz Builder's case the bidder was the lowest bidder and the KWSB instead of accepting a bid resorted to negotiation with the other bidders. High Court ordered that public tenders be again invited. The facts are fairly identical with the present case except one difference: in the present case the tender has been scrapped. Therefore, circumstances in Ayaz Builder's case were on a firmed foundation. In the present case, it has been decided that fresh bids will be invited but have not been invited. In any case tender has already scrapped.
  16. There cannot be any cavil with the proposition laid down in Noor Jehan's case that mere possibility that a person vied to obtain a property by making highest bid does not give any potential bidder a vested right in the property. The same principle would hold true when bids for work ordered to be executed by a public functionary. Mere fact that his bid was the lowest would not ipso facto entitle him to be awarded tender. Nevertheless, if the State functionary who is entrusted with dominion are the public property cannot reject the lowest bid without assigning valid reasons. One may also refer to City Schools case, where it has been held that a tender notice is merely an invitation for making an offer and does not itself constitute an offer or proposal and unless it is accepted no contract in law can be deemed to have come into existence.
  17. In the present case, bids were invited and the petitioner was the lowest bidder. His bid was not yet accepted when it was decided to scrap the tender because in the opinion of the authority the bids was not responsive. Had it been a case where the bid of the petitioner had been rejected for being not responsive and bid of some one else had been accepted, it would have been appropriate to enter into the question whether the bid of the bidder being treated as not responsive was justified in the circumstances or not. However, since all bids have been scrapped and the matter is ordered for re-tendering and since in Ayaz Builder's case where the bid had not been scrapped public authority had merely entered into negotiations with the second and third highest bidders, the High Court had ordered that fresh tenders be invited, we do not think the present case calls for any interference by this Court in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction. Needless to observe if fresh tenders invited and if the petitioner participates in it, it is expected from and required of the authorities of Pakistan Steel that the bids be evaluated in a just, fair and judicious manner which is transparent at the same time and tender is awarded strictly in accordance with the law and the rules while observing highest standards of probity.
  Above are our reasons for the short order announced on 6-4-2010.

JUDGMENT
AHMAD ALI, J.---Accused/ petitioner, Kaleem Anwar, seeks his post arrest bail in case FIR No.208 dated 14.09.2018 under sections 302/324/109/ 427/417/34 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, read with section 15AA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa registered at Police Station Beer, Haripur.
2. The allegations against the accused/ petitioner are that on 14.09.2016 at 'Namashan Wella', he along with acquitted co-accused committed 'Qatl-i-Amd' of Ali Asghar and Malik Iftikhar Khan and caused injuries to Maqsood-ur-Rehman and ineffective firing upon the complainant, Hafeez-ur-Rehman.
3. Arguments heard. Record perused.
4. Perusal of record would reveal that accused/petitioner, Kaleem Anwar along with co-accused Naeem Anwar, Waseem Anwar, Faheem Anwar, Nadeem Anwar is directly charged for commission of the offence at the instance of their father, Muhammad Anwar. The role attributed to the present accused/ petitioner in the commission of the offence is that of committing murder of Malik Iftikhar Khan. All the co-accused having similar role, particularly, co-accused Naeem Anwar have already been acquitted by the learned trial Court after extending benefit of doubt to them vide judgment dated 16.12.2019. The alleged recovery of 'kalashinkov' from possession of the accused/petitioner after four years would be seen by the learned trial Court after recording evidence. Mere abscondence is no ground to refuse bail to the accused/petitioner, particularly, when it calls for further inquiry. It has been held in the case of 'Ehsan Ullah v. The State' (2012 SCMR 1137) that 'It is settled law that in a case calling for further inquiry into the guilt of an accused person bail is to be allowed to him as a of right and not by way of grace on concession and in such a case mere absconsion of the relevant accused person may not be sufficient to refuse bail to him.' This Court considers that accused/ petitioner cannot be kept in jail when his role is at par with that of acquitted co-accused and his guilt is to be adjudged by the learned trial Court on the same evidence on the basis of which co-accused were acquitted. This Court in the case titled 'Naseer v. The State and another' (2019 PCr.LJ Note 136) has observed as under:-
""Thus in a situation where the acquitted co-accused, namely, Basheer, charged with a similar and identical role in the FIR by the complainant/deceased as that of the accused-petitioner and on the same set of evidence, he was acquitted of the charge in appeal, then such acquittal per se takes the case of the accused/petitioner to one of further enquiry, notwithstanding the fact that he remained absconder for a sufficient long time. It needs no reiteration that if an accused is otherwise held entitled to the concession of bail, then abscondence alone shall not come in his way.""
Thus, in view of the above, since identical role ascribed to accused/ petitioner by the complainant, requires 'further inquiry' into his guilt qua commission of the offence, as envisages in subsection (2) of section 497, Cr.P.C., he is entitled to be released on bail in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case.
5. Before parting with this order, this court finds it necessary to mention that all the observations recorded above are tentative assessment just for the disposal of bail petition and not intended to influence the mind of trial Court, which is free to appraise the evidence strictly in accordance with law and merits of the case in view of law laid down in (1996 SCMR 1845).
6. For the reasons mentioned above, this bail petition is accepted and accused/ petitioner is admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (Rupees Two lacs) with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, concerned, who shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.
7. Above are the detailed reasons for short order of this Court of even date.

ORDER
SADIQ MAHMUD KHURRAM, J.---Through the instant petition under section 497, Cr.P.C., the petitioner, namely Muhammad Younis seeks post-arrest bail in the case FIR No. 115 of 2014 dated 15.05.2014 registered at Police Station Haneef Ghori Shaheed Dajal, District Rajanpur in inspect of offences under sections 302, 148, 149 and 34, P.P.C.
2. The allegation against the petitioner, as culled from the evidentiary material produced before the Court, is that he fired with a pistol at the person of the deceased namely Muneer Ahmad hitting him on the right upper arm and left side of the abdomen.
3. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and perused the record with their able assistance.
4. It is discernable from the bare perusal of the FIR and the statements recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C. that as many as seven persons, including the petitioner, were attributed the roles of firing at the person of the deceased namely Muneer Ahmad. The matter does not end here as not only seven accused persons were attributed to have caused injuries with their respective weapons at the deceased but also were ascribed specific number of fires and the seas of injuries. The total number of fires attributed to the seven accused persons in the FIR is eighteen whereas, some of the accused persons were also alleged to have made numerous fires from their weapons hitting at various parts of the body of the deceased. The Medical Officer, who conducted the post-mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased, found only nine entry wounds on his person. As per the allegations contained in the FIR as well as the statements recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C., the said nine entry wounds were attributed to the accused persons as mentioned above. There is a glaring contradiction between the statements of the witnesses and the medical evidence available on record. These factors have been found by the Court to be sufficient to put it to caution regarding the veracity of the allegations levelled by ye complainant party against the petitioner. With regard to the petitioner, it is further observed that the petitioner was alleged to have fired with a pistol at the person of the deceased namely Muneer Ahmad, hitting him on the right upper arm and left side of the abdomen. Similar allegation was leveled against the co-accused of the petitioner namely Muhammad Yousaf, meaning that same injuries were attributed to two different accused. This, prima facie, indicates that the medical evidence available on the record may not be supporting the case of the prosecution vis- -vis the role played by the petitioner. Reliance is placed on the case of Saeed Khan v. The State and others (3011 SCMR 1392) wherein it has been held as under:-
""The record also highlights a glaring contradiction between the FIR/supplementary statement and the Medico-legal Certificate issued in respect of the injured victim inasmuch as according to the FIR/supplementary statement the alleged victim had received, three firearm injuries on his right lower leg at the hands of the culprits but according to the Medico-legal Certificate issued in respect of the alleged victim there was only one fire shot received by him on his right lower leg. These factors have been found by us to be sufficient to put us to caution regarding veracity of the allegations levelled by the complainant party against the petitioner.""
Reliance is also placed on the Case of Muhammad Ramzan v. The State and others (2016 SCMR 2046) wherein it has been held as under:-
""The Post-mortem Examination Report pertaining to the dead body of Humaira deceased showed that the said deceased had sustained only one firearm injury on her left thigh and, thus, the only firearm injury received by the said deceased stood attributed to two accused persons, i.e. the present petitioner and his co-accused namely Muhammad Anwar. The Post-mortem Examination Report further shows that a bullet had been recovered from the firearm injury received by the said lady and during the investigation a gun had been recovered from the petitioner's custody whereas a pistol had been recovered from Muhammad Anwar co-accused. This prima facie indicates that the medical evidence available on the record may not be supporting the case of the prosecution vis-a-vis the role played by the petitioner.""
Reliance is also placed on the case of Asmatullah v. The State and others (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 178) wherein it has been held as under:--
""The Post-mortem Examination Report in respect of the deceased shows that the deceased had received only ore fire-shot and that solitary fire-shot stands attributed by the prosecution to three accused persons including respondent No.2. It is, thus, not clear at this stage as to whether any injury had been ""caused by the said respondent to the deceased or not.""
Reliance is also placed on the case of Liaqat Ali v. The State and others (2013 SCMR 1527) wherein it has been held as under:--
""The FIR is inconsistent qua him inasmuch as in the earlier part of the FIR, it is alleged that he was armed with an iron rod whereas in the operative part it is alleged that he was carrying a hatchet and further that he and Sajid co-accused gave hatchet blows on Ahmad Ali which landed or the left side of his back. There is, however, only one injury i.e. injury No.2 on that side.

10. The question as to who caused, injury No. 2 would remain a moot point.""
Mere involvement in a heinous offence is no ground for refusing bail to an accused who otherwise becomes entitled for the concession of bail. The co-accused of the petitioner namely Ghulam Yaseen, Rashid, Pari, Muhammad Jaz and Muhammad Asif have already been admitted to bail by this Court. Tentatively assessing the material on record, the case of the petitioner would call for further enquiry and he also deserves his release on bail on account of identical part played by him with that of his co-accused Ghularn Yaseen, Rashid, Pari, Muhammad ljaz and Muhammad Asif, who have been admitted to bail. This approach would be legally justified on the principle of consisteacy. Reliance in this behalf is placed on the cases of Shah Nawar and others v. The State and another (2008 SCMR 1436), Muhammad Azam v. The State (2008 SCMR 249), Muhammad Daud and another v. The State and another (2008 SCMR 173) and Shahid Hussain alias Multani v. The State and others (2011 SCMR 1673).
5. It has vehemently been argued by the learned Deputy Prosecutor General appearing on behalf of the State that the petitioner had remained a ""Proclaimed Offender"" for about 05- years after registration of this case and, thus, he is not entitled to the concession of bail. It is a settled law that in a case calling for further inquiry into the guilt of an accused person bail is to be allowed to him as of right and not by way of grace of concession and in such a case mere absconding of the relevant accused person may not be sufficient to refuse bail to him. A reference in this respect may be made to the cases of ""Muhammad Sadiq v. Sadiq and others"" (PLD 1985 SC 182), ""Ibrahim v. Hayat Gul and others"" (1985 SCMR 382) and ""Qamar alias Mitho v. The State and others' (PLD 2012 SC 222). Different persons have been differently created by ALLAH ALMIGHTY. Sometimes a person, instead of facing the situation/crises opts to go into hiding believing, that his period of desolation and distress may go by as the time would pass along. The world is not empty of the chivalrous either who show bravery, poise or courage to confront a most tempestuous and chaotic situation without having second thought. It is merely the difference of vibes which makes he human beings behave and react peculiarly. There is, however, no denial to the fact that everyone fears the ire of the police, though in variant degrees. If one despite being innocent takes a decision out of fearfulness or anxiety to escape to a safer haven, the other one, also placed in identical situation, despite having certain reservations, may decide to bear the brunt of the upheavals in a virile way. The factum of abscondence, may not be a deciding factor, while deciding the bail plea of an accused. The attending circumstances of the case and a cautious study thereof would be relevant for decision of a bail application on the touchstone of further inquiry as contemplated under section, 497(2), Cr.P.C. The element of abscondence must give way to the bail plea of an accused whose case categorically constitutes need for further inquiry.
6. For what has been discussed above, the case of the petitioner becomes one of further inquiry covered by subsection (2) of section 497, Cr.P.C. Liability of petitioner for the said offence would be determined by the learned trial court after sifting be evidentiary worth of the material produced before the same. Till then, case of the petitioner would be within the domain of section 497(2), Cr.P.C. calling for further inquiry into the petitioner's guilt. The petition in hand is accepted and the petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs. I 000,000/- (rupee; One Million only) with two sureties each, in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial court.
7 Needless to mention that any observations made in the above order are tentative in nature and shall not influence the trial court. Additionally, a direction is issued to the learned trial court to conclude the trial of the petitioner expeditiously, preferably within a period of three months from the receipt of copy of this order. It is made clear that if the petitioner or any person acting on his behalf causes delay in the conclusion of the trial then the trial court shall be at liberty to cancel the bail of the petitioner in accordance with law.

ORDER
MUHAMMAD FAISAL KAMAL ALAM, J.---Through this application, applicant Roshan Cholyani son of Singho Cholyani has sought for his release on bail after arrest in Crime No.110/2012, registered at Police Station Warrah, for offences punishable under sections 302, 109, 337H(2), 148, 149 P.P.C after his similar prayer was declined by learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Kamber, vide Order dated 30.04.2019.
2. The facts of the case of prosecution are that on 03.11.2012 at about 1500 hours, complainant Imam Ali lodged FIR at Police Station Warrah, regarding dispute with Shafqat and Imdad Cholyani over land and water course; the complainant, his son Deedar, nephews Ghulam Asghar and Nephew's son Saifullah were available at the Photostat and computer shop being run by his nephews; when at about 02:30 p.m. they saw seven armed persons came towards them, out of them they identified five persons, namely, Khalid Hussain, Bhale Dino alias Bhallo, Awais, Fayyaz and Hassan Ali all by caste Cholyani armed with T.T Pistols along with two other unidentified persons armed with Kalashnikovs (K.K.). The men armed with pistols opened fire at the son of Complainant, namely, Deedar and his nephew's son Saifullah in order to commit their murder, which hit them, resultantly they fell down and when complainant side raised hue and cry, the armed persons fled away while firing in the air; blood was oozing from the injured persons, who succumbed to the injuries while shifting to the hospital. The name of the accused was not transpired in the FIR, but his name was introduced by the P.Ws in their statements under section 164, Cr.P.C. and he was declared as proclaimed offender; the accused was arrested on 06.03.2019 by the police.
3. Learned counsel for the applicant has contended that; the applicant is innocent and has been falsely implicated by the complainant party due to previous enmity; that the other co-accused Khair Muhammad, whose name was also not mentioned in the FIR like that of the present accused, has already been granted bail by the learned Trial Court; that neither the name of the applicant is mentioned in the FIR nor any specific role has been assigned to the present applicant/ accused. The learned counsel prays for grant of bail under the rule of consistency.
4. Learned D.P.G. vehemently opposed the grant of bail in favour of applicant on the grounds that; the name of the present applicant has been introduced by the P.Ws. in their statements recorded under section 164, Cr.P.C. before the learned Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate-I Warrah; the applicant / accused was having K.K at the time of incident and made aerial firing at the scene of offence; further the present applicant remained fugitive from law for about five years, hence he is not entitled for the concession of bail.
5. Heard arguments of the learned counsel for the applicant, learned D.P.G and considered the material available on record.
6. From the perusal of record it transpires that; in the FIR, the present Applicant / Accused has not been nominated. The prosecution witness (Ghulam Asghar) has mentioned the name of present Applicant / Accused in his Statement under section 164, Cr.P.C, that too on 10.12.2012, that is, after more than one month of lodging of FIR. The role assigned to the present Applicant/ Accused in the said statement is that he and co-accused Khair Muhammad, whose name was also not mentioned in FIR, were armed with Kalashnikovs and standing outside the shop, that is, the place of incident and they both resorted to aerial firing and then ran away; no specific role of firing has been assigned to the present Applicant/Accused causing the death of above named persons. Under the similar circumstances the above named co-accused Khair Muhammad has already been admitted to bail by the learned Trial Court vide order dated 18.04.2014. Hence rule of consistency is also applicable to the case of the present applicant/accused. It is also note worthy that the parties under the dispute belong to same community and are known to each other, inter alia, due to previous hostility, as also mentioned in the FIR, but despite that, complainant party had not mentioned the name of the present applicant/accused either in the FIR nor statements of P.Ws recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C., but his (present applicant) name was first time surfaced in the Statement under section 164, Cr.P.C. as mentioned hereinabove, which creates doubt that the name of the accused has been mentioned after due deliberation and consultation amongst the complainant party. In these circumstances, I am of the considered view that guilt of the applicant in this crime can only be proved after further enquiry. It is also note worthy to mention here that mere abscondence of an accused cannot be made ground to reject his bail application, as observed by the learned Trial Court in the afore-referred order dated 30.04.2019, if an accused is otherwise entitled to the concession of bail, considering the principle laid down in a number of judicial pronouncement. Interestingly, the order of the learned Trial Court, refusing the bail also observes that the present applicant/ accused is a Government School Teacher and was drawing his salary in all those years. This aspect also prima facie shows that the present applicant/ accused in all these years was performing his duty and drawing his salaries in a routine manner.
7. In view of the above, I find no valid reason to decline the concession of bail to the applicant, therefore, instant bail application is allowed and the applicant Roshan Cholyani is admitted to bail subject to his furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (Rupees Two Hundred Thousand only) and P.R Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned Trial Court.
8. If the Applicant/accused misuses the concession of bail then the learned Trial Court may take strict action against him in accordance with law; with a further clarification that the learned Trial Court will not be influenced by any of the observations contained hereinabove and decide the case on merits and after appreciation of the evidence.

JUDGMENT
LUBNA SALEEM PERVEZ, J.---This petition for bail after arrest under section 497, Cr.P.C. has been filed by Imran Khan, who has been arrested on the complaint of one Liaqat Ali Khan, in case FIR No.30, dated 22.10.2019, for offences under sections 20, 21, 24 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 read with sections 500, 506 and 109/34, P.P.C., registered at Police Station, Cyber Crimes reporting Centre, Islamabad.
2. The facts in brief are that, the above cited FIR against the petitioner along with other accused persons was registered on the complaint of Liaqat Ali Khan, for sending immodest and indecent pictures of the complainant and his family members and messages with abusive language through What's App cell phone Nos. 0345-5975421 and 0349-5401030 and through following created/operated Facebook profiles:-
(i) Imran Khan (cousin of Awais Khan), at Facebook Profile Khan Imran Khan having URL:
www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100016078606630;
(ii) Shahbaz Khan, at Facebook profile Shahbaz Khan having URL:

(iv) at webpage ""ChakMansoor News"" having URL:
https://www.facebook.com/KhaN.Group.ChaKMaNsOoR.786/.
3. Allegedly, the accused used to upload superimposed and fabricated sexually explicit pictures with derogatory and filthy language by using above mentioned links and means of social media with the intention to harass, defame the complainant, his wife, sons and daughters including a minor daughter.
4. Learned Counsel for the Petitioner/accused submitted that he has been involved in the case on account of enmity between the families of the complainant and his real brother, the father of co-accused Awais Khan who have more than 15 years old history of family animosity over properties. The hatred between them was developed when Tariq, the son of the complainant broke engagement with said co-accused's sister. Learned counsel argued that the present FIR is a counter blast of another FIR registered by family of the co-accused Awais Khan for same offences under PECA 2016, against son of the complainant, whose bail petition has also been rejected by the Hon'ble Sindh High Court; that the petitioner is a civil servant and has unblemished service record; that no specific role has been assigned to the Petitioner in the FIR; that the petitioner although received those pictures but has not transmitted the same onward; that the petitioner has been involved in fake, frivolous, baseless and ill-founded case; that the petitioner has voluntarily surrendered himself to the authorities after the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 07.04.2020 as he was released on bail, vide order of the Hon'ble Islamabad High Court dated 20.03.2020; that the petitioner has no criminal history; that the case is of further inquiry and the investigation in respect of the petitioner has already been completed thus his incarceration would serve no useful purpose; that there is also no possibility of tampering the prosecution evidence or record by the petitioner. Learned Counsel placed reliance on case of Muhammad Hayat Khan v. The State (2019 PCr.LJ 472) and submitted that in view of settled principles under section 497(2), Cr.P.C., the petitioner is eligible for grant of bail in the instant case.
5. On the other hand, learned Counsel for the complainant vehemently opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the accused/petitioner and objected the grant of bail to the accused while submitting that the petitioner has been nominated with specific role in the FIR for having created the face book links for the purposes of uploading and transmitting the fabricated derogatory pictures and indecent material by using whatsapp having cell phone sims in his name, against the family of the complaint, more particularly against the female family members, thus has direct nexus in the criminal activity under consideration along with his cousin Awais Khan and other co-accused persons; that the petitioner has been removed from service as such is no more a civil servant; that the offences, though, do not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C. but the offences are extremely immoral which involve question of reputation of a respectable family and more importantly dignity and modesty of ladies who are school and college students. Learned counsel further contended that grant of bail cannot be claimed as of a right and each and every case is to be dealt with on the basis of its own facts and circumstances, that the bail of his co-accused namely Awais Khan has also been rejected by this Court vide Crl. Misc. No. 109-B/2020 dated 09.03.2020. Thus having common set of facts and circumstances, the accused is not entitled for concession of bail and this petition is also liable to be dismissed.
6. I have heard the learned counsel for the rival parties and have also perused the relevant record submitted by the IO through State Counsel.
7. Examination of the record revealed that the complainant and all the accused are relatives and allegations against all of them are similar, comprising the offence of superimposing, fabricating, preparing and transmitting illicit, immoral pictures of the family members of complainant using different means of social media i.e facebook and whatsapp by also using filthy, abusive, derogatory and defamatory language. It is noted that another FIR has been registered against son of complainant Tariq in FIA, Cyber Crime Reporting Center, Karachi invoking the provisions of sections 16, 20, 21 of PECA 2016 read with 419 and 109, P.P.C. and the bail of accused Tariq has been rejected by the Hon'ble Sindh High Court, Karachi. Moreover, the Criminal Petition No. 1028 of 2019 against the said bail refusal order has also been dismissed by Hon'ble Supreme Court.
8. I have also gone through the bail rejection order dated 09.03.2020 of the other co-accused namely Awais Khan who happens to be the nephew of the complainant. Record transpired that the contention of the Learned Counsel of the Petitioner regarding old enmity between rival party is correct, but that cannot be made ground for considering the grant of bail when investigation record of subscriber information of the creator of Facebook ID and link as well as cell phone number against which Whatsapp account was created depicts the name of the petitioner and point towards his direct connection with the offence and also shows uploading and transmitting the indecent, offensive and vulgar pictures and material against the complainant and his family member from those accounts. The argument of non-assigning of specific role to the petitioner has no weight thus rejected.
9. The case record produced by FIA shows that petitioner, during investigation, admitted receiving, transmitting, sharing, uploading derogatory and indecorous, fabricated photos of the complainant and his family members including female members for the purposes of defaming them. Data of facebook and whatsapp collected from cell phones of the accused/petitioner and other co-accused was retrieved and also sent for forensic analysis and examination. In addition, information in respect of facebook URLs created and operated by all the accused were also obtained by the facebook authorities. All the information/data of conversation at whatsapp, forensic examination report of the cell phones and information and verification of URL and IDs received from facebook authority prima facie constitute sufficient incriminating material against the accused/petitioner shows existence of reasonable grounds of the accused/petitioner's involvement in the alleged offence and disentitle him for the concession of bail. Learned Counsel for the Complainant also informed the Court that Awais Khan was released on bail, vide order dated 20.03.2020, passed by the Hon'ble Islamabad High Court, on the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, however, after setting aside of the said order by Hon'ble Supreme Court on 07.04.2020, he is now absconder. Moreover, the other co-accused have also been declared proclaimed offenders. The contention of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner that offence in the present case do not fall within the prohibitory clause has no force as the law has also been settled in this regard that mere fact that the offence does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C., does not mean that the offence becomes bailable, as it is also well settled that the concession of bail cannot be claimed as a right. The concession of bail is legally allowable where nature of offence is not heinous and against the society; where there is no possibility of repetition of offence; where there are prima facie evidence of fake and frivolous involvement of the petitioner; where there is no chance of abscondence; when there is no chance of tampering with evidence of prosecution and that petitioner is not a habitual offender has no previous criminal history and that the concession of bail will not be misused by the Petitioner. All these possibilities are taken into consideration while considering the present petition for grant of bail after arrest. Regarding accepting/refusing of bail involving similar offence as in the instant case, the Hon'ble Sindh High Court in case titled Farhan Kamrani v. The State (2018 YLR 329) on the arguments that offence being out of the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C., has held as under:-
""9. Although, the offence under section 21 of the Act does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C. being punishable up to five (05) years, but in such like cases the grant of bail is not a right of the accused but a concession and since the accused is prima facie involved in a case of superimposing a photograph of the face of a woman over sexually explicit image, he is not entitled to the concession of bail simply for the reason that he is connected with such offence, which seriously affect the whole society. The accused has apparently gone to grotesque lengths to humiliate the complainant online, which may cause a detrimental effect on her. It may be observed that the impact of uploading on internet the superimposed porn photographs of a woman is more than the shame and shock that one might feel when she discovers herself to be the victim of this crime. The immediate real time effect is the social stigmatization of the victim by blaming her for the pictures and questioning her character. This may lead to depression, social alienation and in some extreme cases suicide attempts by the victim who cannot handle the pressure of dealing with such targeted vengeance. Under the circumstances, the accused is not entitled to the concession of bail; therefore, this application is dismissed, accordingly"".
10. Respectfully following the above cited judgment and keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the present case, instant bail petition, being devoid of any merit, is hereby dismissed. However, the learned trial Court is directed to conclude the trial of the case in accordance with law, expeditiously, preferably within a period of four (4) months from receipt of copy of this judgment.
11. It is made clear that the observations made hereinabove, being tentative in nature, shall not prejudice the case of either party.

JUDGMENT
SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.---Through this criminal miscellaneous bail application, the petitioner Jahan Daraz alias Jahan Gully son of Muhammad Khan seeks post-arrest bail in case vide FIR No. 110 dated 13.3.1998 registered under section 302, P.P.C. at Police Station sadder Bannu.
2. The prosecution case as disclosed in the FIR are that on 13.3.1998 at 08:15 hours brought his brother Shahbaz Khan in injured condition in the emergency room of Civil Hospital Bannu and reported the matter to the police that on the eventful day he along with his brother Shahbaz Khan and paternal uncle Gul Hyder were present near Masjid Fatma Khel. In the meanwhile, petitioner - accused while armed with riffle appeared and attempted at the life of Shahbaz Khan by firing at him as a result whereof Shahbaz Khan was injured seriously. After commission of the offence, the accused fled-away from the spot. The complainant could do nothing being empty handed. The motive as alleged in the FIR is that Shahbaz Khan injured had purchased house from maternal uncle of the accused over which the petitioner was annoyed. Lateron, Shahbaz Khan succumbed to his injuries, on the same day at 11:00 AM, hence, petitioner was booked in the FIR.
3. On 10.3.2018 the petitioner was arrested whereafter, he moved an application for release on bail, which was declined by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Bannu vide order dated 11.5.2018, hence, this petition.
4. It is argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the occurrence has not taken place in the mode and manner as stated by the complainant; that site-plan, version of the complainant and PM report if placed in juxta position are contradictory inter alia; that the injured minor namely-Nasir Khan whose presence was shown at point-2 of the site-plan, his presence was not disclosed in the FIR,; that bail cannot be denied merely on abscondence, if the case is other-wise fit for grant of bail.
5. As against that the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the complainant and the learned Addl: A.G representing the State argued that the petitioner has specifically been nominated in the FIR for committing murder of Shahbaz Khan; that the occurrence took place in the broad day light, therefore, there is no chance of mis-identification; that after commission of the offence, accused remained at large for about 20 years, therefore, he does not deserve the concession of bail; that trial has already commenced and charge has been framed against the accused.
6. Arguments heard and record perused with the able assistance of learned counsel for the parties.
7. Perusal of the record reveals that the petitioner has specifically been nominated in the FIR for committing murder of the brother of complainant in a promptly lodged FIR ruling-out the possibility of contemplation, deliberation and consultation. Besides complainant, the occurrence was also witnessed by paternal cousin of complainant namely-Gul Hyder. After commission of offence, the petitioner remained absconder for a period of about 20 years. The medico legal report supports the contention of the complainant. No doubt in the FIR the petitioner is not charged for causing Fire-arm injury to the minor Nasir Khan, but, subsequently it was disclosed that the minor Nasir Khan also sustained injuries at the hands of the petitioner, and his presence has been shown at Point-2 in the site-plan.
8. Perusal of the record further reveals that the crime in question having been taken place on 13.3.1998 while the petitioner was arrested on 10.3.2018. It is settled law that fugitive from law loses some of the normal rights granted by the procedural and substantive law and noticeable abscondence dis-entitles the absconder to the concession of bail notwithstanding the merits of the case. In this respect reliance can well be placed on the cases reported as Awal Khan and others v. The State (PLD 1985 SC 402) and Raza Khan v. State (2013 MLD 810).
9. Moreso, the trial in the instant case has already commenced and charge has been framed against the accused on 16.3.2018. Normally the Courts avoid to grant bail in the case in which either the challan has been put in the Court and the trial is likely to commence short or the trial has begun. In this respect reliance can well be placed on the cases reported as Mindad v. State (1992 SCMR 1448) and Syed Akbar and another v. Gul Akbar and another (1996 SCMR 931).
10. In view of specific charge supported by the eye-witnesses coupled with noticeable abscondence sufficiently provide reasonable grounds to believe that the petitioner is guilty of an offence charged with which falls within the prohibition contained in Section 497, Cr.P.C, therefore, he is not entitled to the concession of bail. This bail application fails which is hereby dismissed. However, the trial Court is directed to conclude the trial expeditiously within four (04) months.

JUDGMENT
SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.---Through the instant Cr. Misc. Petition No.186-B of 2018, petitioner Irfanullah son of Saee-ur-Rahman alias Saki seeks post arrest bail in Crime Report No.559 dated 25.11.2017, registered under sections 302/ 324/ 109/148/149, P.P.C. of Police Station Yaqoob Khan Shaheed, district Karak.
2. The prosecution story as given in the crime report, is that complainant Kamal Khana wife of Khan Wali reported to the police at Emergency Ward of Civil Hospital Takht-e-Nasrati that on 25.11.2017 at 0900 hours, she and her brother Wali Khan while coming from house situated in Wanki to Garang Siraj Kjel, accused Shams ur Rehman, Khalil Rehman, sons of Sawab Rehman and accused/petitioner Irfanullah, who were already sitting in ambush, came out of their Hujra and started firing at them with the intention to commit their qatl-i-amd with deadly weapons, resultantly she (complainant) was hit and got injured, while her brother Khan Wali was also got hit and died on the spot; that the accused committed the offence on the instigation of Sawab Rehman and Mst. Chanara. Motive as disclosed in the FIR is previous blood feud enmity. Hence her report was culminated into FIR (ibid).
3. After arrest, the petitioner applied for post arrest, which was declined by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Karak at Takht-e-Nasrati, vide order dated 12.6.2018. Hence, this petition.
4. It has been contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner is innocent and has falsely been implicated in the instant case; that from the perusal of the site plan, point No.1 is not visible from points Nos.2, 3 and 4; that the medicolegal report and the MLC of the injured does not support the version of the complainant; that prima facie, there exists no reasonable grounds to believe that the petitioner has committed the alleged offence; that the prosecution case requires further inquiry into the guilt of the accused/petitioner; that at the time of alleged occurrence, accused/petitioner was present in Quetta in connection with his official duty in the School of Infantry and Tactics Quetta Cantonment and this fact has been affirmed during inquiry; that co-accused Sawab-ur Rahman has already been released on bail by this Court vide order dated 18.02.2018, therefore keeping in view principle of consistency, the accused/ petitioner is also entitled to be released on bail.
5. Conversely, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the complainant and the learned A.A.G representing the State vehemently opposed the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner and argued that the petitioner has specifically been charged for committing murder of brother of the complainant; that plea of alibi taken by the petitioner is concocted one and afterthought, therefore not worth consideration at this stage; that after commission of offence the petitioner remained at large for a noticeable period; that the trial has already been commenced; that the offence with which the petitioner is charged , falls within the prohibitory clause of Section 497, Cr.P.C, therefore he does not deserve the concession of bail.
6. I have heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with their valuable assistance.
7. Perusal of the record reveals that petitioner is one of the nominated accused, who has specifically been charged for committing murder of brother of the complainant. In the instant incident, the complainant herself sustained bullet injury on her thigh. The perusal of PM report would show that the deceased Wali Khan has sustained multiple injuries on his body. The parties are known to each other, therefore there is no chance of misidentification. The motive as alleged in the FIR is previous blood feud enmity between the parties. After commission of offence, the petitioner remained at large for quite sufficient time, he was declared proclaimed offender.
8. The role attributed to the co-accused Sawab ur Rahm, who has been granted bail by this Court, is distinguish-able. The record reflects that he has been attributed role of abetement while role of firing at the complainant party was attributed to the accused/ petitioner.
9. Adverting to plea of alibi, suffice is to say that it was not taken in the earliest.
10. No doubt plea of alibi like other defence plea taken at bail stage is essentially required to be examined by the Court within a degree of care and caution. This belated plea of alibi, prima facie creates an impression that it was after thought. However, I leave its evidentiary value to be decided by the learned trial Court after recording pro and contra evidence.
11. In view of specific charge supported by the eye-witnesses, medical evidence and unexplained noticeable abscondence sufficiently provide reasonable grounds to believe that the petitioner is guilty of an offence charged with, petitioner is guilty of an offence charged with, which falls within the prohibitory Clause of Section 497, Cr.P.C.
12. It is pertinent to mention here that after completion of investigation challan has been submitted and trial is likely to commence soon. In such situation, it has all long been settled principle of law, set by august Supreme Court of Pakistan, when the trial is likely to commence or has begun, bail application should not be decided on merits and the matter be left to the trial Court, lest it may prejudice case of either side. In this respect, reliance can well be placed on the cases reported as Muhammad Sadiq and others v. The State (1980 SCMR 203), Muhammad Ismail v. Muhammad Rafique and others (PLD 1989 SC 585), Mian Dad v. The State and another (1992 SCMR 1418), Said Akbar and another v. Gul Akhtar and another (1992 SCMR 931) and Shahid Farooq v. The State and others (2011 SCMR 1619).
13. For what has been discussed above, there is no merits in this petition, which is hereby dismissed.
It is clarified that any observations made in this order is tentative in nature, confined only to the extent of bail matter which would not influence the mind of the trial Court in any manner who shall decide the case by applying its own independent judicial mind after recording evidence.

JUDGMENT
SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.--- Petitioner Fareedun son of Zarif Khan, seeks his release on bail in Crime No.1079 dated 11.09.1999 registered under Sections 302/324/34, P.P.C. at Police Station Kalu Khan, wherein he is charged for committing murder of Abdullah Jan and attempting at the lives of complainant and one Farhad.
2. At the very outset, the learned counsel for the petitioner drew the attention of the Court to the affidavit sworn by the complainant Syed Mahmood Shah Bacha appended with the petition at page-20 and argued that the complainant has stated in the affidavit that he has falsely charged the present petitioner, therefore, the prosecution case requires further inquiry into the guilt of the petitioner.
3. As against that, the learned AAG representing the State argued that the evidentiary value of the affidavit is to be adjudged during the trial after recording evidence; that after commission of offence, the petitioner remained at large for more than 18 years; that the petitioner has specifically been charged for committing murder of deceased Abdullah Jan; the post mortem report supports the contention of the complainant.
4. Mst. Ishrat daughter of the deceased appeared in person and contended that the complainant has effected compromise with the petitioner after taking money from him, therefore, the affidavit appended with the petition is not worth consideration.
5. I have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the accused-petitioner, the learned AAG appearing on behalf of the State and daughter of the deceased Abdullah Jan.
6. Perusal of the record reflects that petitioner is one of the nominated accused for committing murder of deceased Abdullah Jan and attempting at the lives of the complainant and Farhad. After commission of offence, the petitioner remained at large for more than 18 years, he was arrested on 21.4.2018 and he has not offered any explanation for his noticeable abscondence, much less plausible. It is settled law that fugitive from law looses some of his normal rights, procedural as well as substantial, and bail may be refused on the sole ground of abscondence regardless of the merits of the case. In the case titled Muhammad Sadiq v. Sadiq and others (PLD 1985 SC 182) bail allowed by the Peshawar High Court, Abbottabad Bench, was cancelled by the august Supreme Court, wherein there was unexplained noticeable abscondence of 06 months of the accused. Same view was expressed by their lordships in the cases titled Awal Gul v. Zawar Khan and others (PLD 1985 SC 402) and Ibrahim v. Hayat Gul and others (1985 SCMR 382) and latest in the line is Raja Fazal ur Rehman v. Muhammad Afzal and others (2010 SCMR 179).
7. Perusal of the Post Mortem report of deceased Abdullah Jan reveals that he has sustained multiple firearm injuries on his body which too supports the prosecution. Coming to the affidavit appended with the petition, in the absence of the complainant, I leave its evidentiary value to be decided by the learned trial Court, mere submission of an affidavit by the complainant as alleged by the learned counsel for the petitioner in his absence would not make it out a case of further inquiry.
8. Another important development worth while to be mentioned is that supplementary challan has been put in Court and trial has commenced, and in such a situation, it has all along been the settled principle of law set by the august Supreme Court that when the case is fixed for evidence or the trial has begun or likely to commence, bail application should not be considered on merits and the matter be left to the trial Court, lest it may prejudice the case of either side. In this respect reliance can be placed on the cases reported as Muhammad Sadik and others v. The State (1980 SCMR 203), Muhammad Ismail v. Muhammad Rafique and another (PLD 1989 SC 585), Mian Dad v. The State and another (1992 SCMR 1418), Said Akbar and another v. Gul Akbar and another (1996 SCMR 931) and Shahid Farooq v. The State and others (2011 SCMR 1619).
9. For what has been discussed above, this petition being bereft of merit is dismissed. However, the learned trial Court is directed to conclude the trial expeditiously. The office is directed to send the record back immediately.

ORDER
QAISER RASHID KHAN, J.---Accused/petitioner Naseer seeks his release on bail in case FIR No. 1091, dated 25-8-2012, under sections 302/34, P.P.C. of Police Station Charsadda, District Charsadda, with the allegations that he along with his co-accused Basheer had fired at the complainant Abid with which he was injured and later on succumbed to the injuries in the hospital.
2. The learned counsel for the accused/petitioner inter alia contends that the co-accused namely Basheer, with a similar role of firing, has already been acquitted of the charge, by this court, vide judgment in Cr. A. No. 698-P/2015 decided on 9th March, 2017 and that the fate of the trial of the accused/petitioner Naseer would not be different.
3. The learned Additional Advocate General assisted by the learned counsel for the complainant, on their turn, resist the submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner and contend that the accused/petitioner after the commission of the offence preferred to remain fugitive from law for more than six long years and surfaced only after the acquittal of his co-accused Basheer and hence, being directly charged with a specific role, he is not entitled to the concession of bail.
4. Arguments heard and the available record perused.
5. As per the FIR ibid, it was on 25.8.2012 at 8.45 a.m. when Abid (complainant) reported in injured condition as to how on the fateful day, while he was proceeding to Tehsil Bazar from his house on his motor cycle and when reached the place of occurrence at 8.15 a.m., Basheer (acquitted co-accused) and Naseer (accused/petitioner) having already waylaid at the spot, started firing at him with their respective weapons and caused him firearm injuries. The injured complainant later on succumbed to the injuries in the hospital.
6. The complainant in his dying declaration assigned a similar role of firing at him to both the accused i.e. accused/petitioner and his acquitted co-accused Basheer, with their respective firearms and from the spot, seven empties of .30 bore pistol were recovered which as per report of the Forensic Science Laboratory were fired from one and the same weapon. The acquitted co-accused, namely Basheer, arrested on 26.4.2014, was convicted and sentenced to death by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-V, Charsadda, on 26.11.2015 but the appeal bearing No. 698-P/2015 preferred by the said co-accused, was allowed by this court, vide judgment dated 9.3.2017 and he was acquitted of the charge.
Thus in a situation where the acquitted co-accused, namely, Basheer, charged with a similar and identical role in the FIR by the complainant/deceased as that of the accused-petitioner and on the same set of evidence, he was acquitted of the charge in appeal, then such acquittal per se takes the case of the accused/petitioner to one of further enquiry, notwithstanding the fact that he remained absconder for a sufficient long time. It needs no reiteration that if an accused is otherwise held entitled to the concession of bail, then abscondence alone shall not come in his way.
7. Accordingly, this petition is allowed and the petitioner is admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two lakh), with two sureties, each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Illaqa/Judicial Magistrate who shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.
8. Needless to mention that the observations recorded in this order are tentative in nature and shall not prejudice the proceedings before the learned trial court where the case be decided on its own merits after recording evidence.

JUDGMENT/ORDER
SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.---The petitioners namely Safaidullah Shah and Imran Ali Shah through the instant petition seek their post arrest bail in crime report No.369 dated 30/11/2010, registered under sections 302/324/34, P.P.C. at Police Station Ghoriwala, District Bannu.
2. The prosecution story as given in the crime report, is that on 30.11.2010, the complainant Andaz Ali Khan at about 2150 hours brought the dead body of his brother Barkat Khan to the Civil Hospital Bannu and lodged report to the effect that on same night he was present in his house and his brother Barkat Khan informed him that accused/petitioners Safaidullah and Imran had snatched articles from him, so he wanted to make a complaint to their parents; that complainant, deceased and one Dil Robaz Khan proceeded towards the house of accused/petitioners, however, when they reached near the houses of one Rizwan, the accused/ petitioners emerged; that accused/petitioner Safaidullah made firing at Barkat Ali (brother of complainant) and accused/petitioner Imran made firing at complainant, resultantly they both were hit and got injured. The accused/petitioners decamped from the spot after the occurrence. Both the injured were taken to the hospital, but Barkat Ali succumbed to the injuries on the way to the hospital. Hence, the accused/petitioners were booked in case FIR (ibid).
3. After arrest, the petitioners applied for post arrest, which was declined by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV Bannu, vide order dated 02-07-2018. Hence, this petition.
4. It has been contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners are innocent and have falsely been implicated merely on the basis of suspicion; that the alleged occurrence took place in the darkness of night, and the complainant has not disclosed the source of light in which the petitioners were identified, therefore, identification of accused was not possible; that the PM report of the deceased discloses charring marks on his body which is in conflict with the distance shown in the site plan; that mere abscondence of the petitioners would not disentitle them to the concession of bail; that the prosecution case requires further probe into the guilt of the petitioners, therefore, they deserve the concession of bail.
5. Conversely, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the complainant and the learned A.A.G. representing the State vehemently opposed the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners and argued that the petitioners have specifically been charged for committing murder of brother of the complainant and also causing injuries to the complainant; that the parties are residents of one and the same area and distance between the accused and complainant party, as shown in the site plan, are very close to each other, therefore, there was no chance of misidentification; that after commission of offence the petitioners remained at large for a noticeable period which lends further support to the case of prosecution and that after arrest of the accused, Challan has been submitted and the trial has already been commenced, so at this stage, petitioners are not entitled to the concession of Bail; that the medico-legal report, site plan and version of the complainant, if placed in a juxtaposition, are consistent, inter alia; that the offence with which the petitioner is charged, falls within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C., therefore, they do not deserve the concession of bail.
6. I have heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with their valuable assistance.
7. Perusal of the record reveals that the FIR was lodged with promptitude wherein the petitioners have specifically been nominated for committing murder of brother of the complainant and effectively firing at the complainant. Admittedly the parties are co villagers and the distance between the accused and complainant party are short, therefore, there was no chance of mis-identification, though the occurrence has taken place at night time. After commission of offence, they remained at large for more than seven years and were declared proclaimed offenders.
8. The crime in question having taken place on 30-11-2010, the petitioners were arrested on 27.09.2017, they remained absconders for more than 7 years and were declared as proclaimed offenders. It is settled law that fugitive from law loses some of the normal rights granted by the procedural and substantive law and noticeable abscondence disentitles the absconder to the concession of bail, notwithstanding the merits of the case. In this behalf reliance can be placed on the case reported as ""Muhamad Sadiq v. Sadiq and others"" (PLD 1985 SC 182). In this case bail allowed by Peshawar High Court Abbott Abad Bench was cancelled by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan, wherein unexplained noticeable abscondence of six months of the accused was found, same view was expressed by their Lordship in the cases titled ""Awal Gul v. Zawar Khan and others (PLD 1985 SC 402) and Ibrahim v. Hayat Gul and others (1985 SCMR 382) and Raza Fazal -ur-Rehman v. Muhammad Afzal and others (2010 SCMR 179).
9. In this case certain points have been agitated by the learned counsel for the petitioner, i.e., presence of charring marks on the body of the deceased, despite the fact that distance between accused and deceased was shown as four paces, which essentially touches the merits of the case. It is not denied that deeper appreciation or evaluation of material at the stage of bail is not permissible for the grant or refusal of bail and only tentative assessment is to be made. In this respect reliance is placed on the case reported as ""Mumtaz v. The State"" (2012 SCMR 556) and Abdullah Hayee and 2 others v. The State (1996 SCMR 556).
In this behalf reference may also be made to the case reported as Raza Khan v. The State through Advocate General Peshawar and another (2013 MLD 810).
10. It is pertinent to mention here that after completion of investigation challan has been submitted and the trial has been commenced. In such situation, it has all long been settled principle of law, set by august Supreme Court of Pakistan, when the trial is likely to commence or has begun, bail application should not be decided on merits and the matter be left to the trial Court, lest it may prejudice case of either side. In this respect, reliance can well be placed on the cases reported as Muhammad Sadiq and others v. The State (1980 SCMR 203), Muhammad Ismail v. Muhammad Rafique and others (PLD 1989 SC 585), Mian Dad v. The State and another (1992 SCMR 1418), Said Akbar and another v. Gul Akhtar and another (1992 SCMR 931) and Shahid Farooq v. The State and others (2011 SCMR 1619).
11. In view of specific charge supported by the eye-witnesses, medical evidence and un-explained noticeable abscondence sufficiently provide reasonable grounds to believe that the petitioners are guilty of an offence charged with, which falls within the prohibitory Clause of section 497, Cr.P.C.
12. For what has been discussed above, there is no merits in this petition, which is hereby dismissed.
It is clarified that any observations made in this order is tentative in nature, confined only to the extent of bail matter which would not influence the mind of the trial Court in any manner who shall decide the case by applying its own independent judicial mind after recording evidence.
13. The learned trial Court is directed to conclude the trial expeditiously but not later than six months. The office is directed to send the requisitioned record forthwith.

MALIK HAQ NAWAZ, J.---The petitioner has sought the indulgence of this Court for grant of post arrest bail in case under sections 302/324/34, P.P.C. vide FIR No.35/2012 dated 9.8.2012 registered at Police Station Darel.
2. The post arrest bail of the petitioner was refused by the learned trial Court vide judgment/order dated 19.4.2019 and being aggrieved from the said order the petitioner has filed the instant petition before this Court for concession of bail.
3. The case of prosecution narrated in the FIR, has been narrated in para 2 of the impugned judgment, which is reproduced for the purpose of convenience.
""The complainant Saddar son of Syed Mehmood furnished written complaint in Police Station Darail to the effect that on 9.8.2012 after Asar Prayer there was a scuffle between Saifur Rehman and Raza resident of Shaga Manikal which resulted in firing. The complainant alongwith Alim Khan and Mautabar Khan proceeded towards the place of firing as they reached near the house of Jangi Bahadur accused Rehman Sher, Furat Khan, Shafa and Razaullah resident of Manikal Pain opened indiscriminate firing upon them which resulted in murder of Alim Khan while Aman Saeed received gun-shot injuries, in the meantime the petitioner alongwith co-accused namely Shamshad, Sanaullah and Sher Ahmad opened firing causing injury upon Nizam-ud-Din. The motive is stated to be quarrel between Saifur Rehman and Mujawar Khan.""
4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that it was a sudden fight, which ensued after a scuffle between the parties. The co-accused of the petitioner namely Abdul Haleem has been released on bail by the learned trial Court on the ground of further inquiry. Accused Nasrullah has been murdered and accused Shabbir Ahmad has been released by the Police under section 169, Cr.P.C. The case of the petitioner is identical to the case of his co-accused, who has been allowed bail by the learned trial Court. The law of consistency is fully attracted in the case of petitioner. The recovery effected from the petitioner is also fake as the same has not been sent to Forensic Expert for expert opinion.
5. When confronted the learned Dy. A. G. contended that the petitioner/ accused is directly charged in the FIR, with a specific role of causing injuries to the deceased Nizam ud Din. The petitioner/accused remained absconder for a long period of 6 years, hence he is not entitled for concession of bail.
6. The record reveals that the accused is directly charged in the FIR, with a specific role of causing injuries to deceased Nizam-ud-Din. After commission of offence the petitioner/ accused went underground and was arrested after a period of 6 years. As evident from the judgment/order of learned trial Court, the accused/petitioner committed another offence and FIR No. 1/2018 under sections 324/34, P.P.C. was registered against him., The grant of bail to co-accused vide judgment/order dated 4.8.2018, does not entitle the petitioner for concession of bail as ""two wrongs do not make one right"". The legality/ propriety of the judgment/order relating to the co-accused Abdul Haleem, dated 4.8.2018, will be examined at appropriate time, if challenged by the State or complainant.
7. There is a prima facie case against the petitioner and he is not entitled for the concession of bail, which is dismissed.

Date of hearing: 20th June, 2019.
2. Brief facts of the case have been mentioned in the impugned judgment dated 30.5.2019. The relevant para of the said judgment is reproduced as under:--
""Brief facts of prosecution's case according to FIR are that petitioners/accused along with other accomplices attacked on one Muhammad Jamil and attempted to murder him with a sharp edge weapon and also fired on him, complainant and one Syed Amir. Bullets hit Muhammad Jamil and Syed Amir and they got bullet injury. Hence FIR No. 24/2017 has been registered in Police Station Juglote Gilgit under sections 324/34 and 109, P.P.C. on written application of complainant.""
3. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that it was a night occurrence and identity of the petitioners in dark light was not possible. The names of the petitioners have been mentioned in the FIR by the complainant by guess work. There is no independent evidence on record to connect the petitioners with the alleged offences. Lastly that provisions of section 324, P.P.C. are not attracted in the instant case. The recoveries are false and planted. The case of the petitioners is one of the further inquiry and they are entitled for concession of bail. The learned counsel for the petitioners relied on PLD 1996 Kar. 372, PLD 1996 Lah. 261, 2006 PCr.LJ 1051 and 2005 YLR 3229.
4. On the other hand the Dy. A. G. for the State and learned counsel for complainant contended that the petitioners are directly charged in the FIR. The weapons of offences have been recovered from the petitioners. The victim has charged the petitioners for a specific role and the motive for commission of offences is also established. Per learned Dy. A. G the petitioners after commission of offence went underground and were arrested after hectic efforts by the local police. They relied on 2005 YLR 242, 1999 PCr.LJ 866, 2004 PCr.LJ 1087, 2003 MLD 1398 and 2009 PCr.LJ 1058.
5. It is evident from the FIR and the statements recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C. that the petitioners are directly charged in the FIR, weapons of offence have been recovered from the petitioners. The victim who was critically injured in the occurrence has also charged the petitioners in his statement recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C. The petitioners/accused remained absconder for a long period. The absconder of a criminal case loses some of his substantive rights guaranteed to him under law. The wisdom is drawn from PLD 1985 SC 402. The relevant citation is reproduced as under:-
""Abscondence, in proper cases, could be treated as a very important piece of evidence---Fugitive from law and Courts, held, would lose some of their normal rights granted by procedural as also substantive law-- Unexplained noticeable abscondence dis-entitled a person to concession of bail notwithstanding merits of case---Accused by his such conduct thwarts investigation qua him in which valuable evidence like recoveries, etc. was simply lost or was made impossible to be collected by his conduct---Accused, therefore, could not seek a reward for such conduct in becoming fugitive from law---Bail requesting refused to such accused in circumstances.""
6. The long and unexplained abscondence, coupled with the facts, that there is even otherwise a prima facie case against the petitioners, therefore, the instant bail petition is dismissed being meritless.
7. Bail refused.

ORDER
MALIK HAQ NAWAZ, J.---The petitioners were booked for the above mentioned offence vide FIR No. 15/2013 dated 11-05-2013.
2. The petitioners went underground after the occurrence and were after a long abscondence they were arrested.
3. Post-arrest bail of the petitioners was refused by the learned Additional Sessions Judge Diamer vide judgment/order dated 12-12-2018, hence this petition.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the case is false and no worth reliance evidence has been brought on record to connect the petitioners with the alleged offence. The recovery from the petitioner No.2 is inconsequential as the same has not been sent to arms expert for expert opinion. The learned counsel submitted that the petitioners were not arrested intentionally by the local police and the abscondence is only a paper work. The case of both the petitioners is one of the further inquiry and they deserve to be admitted to bail. The learned counsel relied on PLD 2007 Karachi 27, 2007 PCr.LJ 1848 and 2013 MLD 170 in support of his arguments.
5. The learned Dy. Advocate General submitted that it was a day light occurrence and both the petitioners are directly charged in the FIR, with a specific role of causing death of deceased Karimullah. Weapon of offence has been recovered from the accused/petitioner Rehmatullah. Petitioner No.2 was present with petitioner No.1, which has not been denied by the defence. The case is one of the common intentions and both the accused are not entitled for concession of bail. The learned counsel for the complainant relied on 2013 PCr.LJ 1284/1706.
6. The FIR reveals that both the petitioners are nominated in FIR but role of petitioner Faizullah attributed ascribed in the FIR is that he was present with his co-accused at the time of commission of the alleged murder. The question of sharing of common intention will be thrashed at the time of trial after recording of some evidence. No recovery has been effected from petitioner No.2 Faizaullah. Petitioner Faizullah is admitted to bail subject to his furnishing a bail bond of Rs.10,00000/- (ten lac) with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial Court at Chilas. Bail upto the extent of petitioner Rehmatullah is declined, as he is directly charged for opening fatal shots on the person of deceased Karimullah. He went underground after the occurrence and was arrested after a long time. Long and unexplained abscondence militates against him coupled with a specific role of causing death of deceased Karimullah. There is a prima facie case against him and he does not deserve the concession of bail.

2. The prosecution case as set forth in the FIR is that on 21.05.2012 at about 800 hours, Faqir Jan ASI, on receipt of information about the occurrence rushed to the spot and found the dead body of deceased Ijaz lying there. Asfand Yar, complainant present at the spot reported him to the effect that on 20.05.2012, the deceased left his house, but did not return till evening. He was searched, but could not be traced and on 21.05.2012, his dead body was found in the poplar trees standing in the fields of one Sadiqeen. He disclosed that he having no enmity with anybody; did not charge any one by name and will charge the actual culprit (s) on satisfaction. On 4.06.2012, he recorded his statement under section 164, Cr.P.C., wherein he charged present petitioner and co-accused Mst. Nodia Begum (widow of the deceased), for the occurrence, hence, this case.
3. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties, it appears from the record that the occurrence is unseen. Though, complainant has directly nominated the petitioner along with co-accused for commission of the offence in his statement under section 164, Cr.P.C., but he has not disclosed the source on the basis of which he got satisfied about complicity of the petitioner in the commission of offence. No doubt, co-accused Mst. Nodia had recorded her confessional statement wherein she while disclosing about her illicit relation with the present petitioner has attributed the role of murder of the deceased to the petitioner on her instigation, but it appears from the record that this Court while deciding her appeal against conviction by not believing her confessional statement has recorded her acquittal vide judgment dated 09.04.2014. Though, under the provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, confessional statement of an accused against co-accused is to be considered as a circumstance, but when the confessional statement of co-accused Mst. Nodia has not been believed by this Court and there is no direct and circumstantial evidence against the petitioner, whether the prosecution would be able to prove the guilt of the petitioner is a debatable question which makes his case arguable for the purpose of bail. The petitioner has not confessed his guilt before the competent Court of law nor any incriminating articles to link him with the commission of offence has been recovered from his direct or indirect possession. Investigation against the petitioner is complete and he is no more required for further interrogation. In this view of the matter on merit, he is entitled to the concession of bail. As regard abscondance of the petitioner, it has been held by the august Apex Court in case titled, ""Qamar alias Mitho v. The State and others"" (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 222) that right of bail cannot be refused to accused merely on account of his/her abscondance which is a factor relevant only to propriety. Moreover, it has been held by the august apex Court in cases of ""Ibrahim v. Hayat Gul and others"" (1985 SCMR 382) and ""Muhammad Sadiq v. Sadiq and others"" (PLD 1985 SC 182) that in a case calling for further inquiry into the guilt of an accused person bail is to be allowed to the accused as of right and such right cannot be refused merely on account of abscondance of accused. Same view has been reiterated in case titled, ""Ikram ul Haq v. Raja Naveed Sabir and others"" (2012 SCMR 1273).
4. For the reason discussed above, this petition is allowed. Accused/ petitioner is admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of rupees two lace with two local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD concerned.
